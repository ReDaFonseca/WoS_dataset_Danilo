Abstract = {Given that wind farms have high initial investment costs and are not
   easy to move after installation, the amount of energy that can be
   produced in the desired installation area needs to be predicted as
   accurately as possible before installation. Four machine learning
   algorithms are adopted to predict power production based on the daily
   wind speed average and standard deviation. The actual power output is
   calculated from the wind data generated by the numerical weather
   prediction, and its temporal resolution is 1 hour. The R-square (R-2)
   values of the models range from 0.97 to 0.98 while adopting the average
   value of daily wind speed as the input data, and it increases by -1 \%
   with the additional input data of the standard deviation of wind speed.
   The power production is predicted based on the wind data at a relatively
   lower height of 10 m than the hub height, where the R-2 value ranges
   from 0.95 to 0.98. The results could provide the possibility of
   replacing the wind data measurement process at the hub height by that at
   a relatively lower height, reducing the cost of wind data measurement.},

Abstract = {Wind power has grown significantly over the last decade regarding its

   A reliable and accurate approach to wind power forecasting is critical

   forecasting methods can hardly provide the desired accuracy and cause

   affects how wind power companies make energy market decisions. This
   study proposes novel algorithmic approaches utilizing machine learning
   techniques to predict wind turbine power. Applied algorithms include
   extremely randomized trees, light gradient boosting machine, ensemble
   methods, and the CNN-LSTM method. Based on the provided results, the
   lowest mean square error value is related to the CNN-LSTM method,
   indicating that this method is more accurate. Also, the ensemble method

Abstract = {Wind energy is one of the fastest growing sources of energy worldwide.
   This is clear from the high volume of wind power applications that have
   been increased in recent years. However, the uncertain nature of wind
   speed induces several challenges towards the development of efficient
   applications that require a deep analysis of wind speed data and an
   accurate wind energy potential at a site. Therefore, wind speed
   forecasting plays a crucial rule in reducing this uncertainty and
   improving application efficiency. In this paper, we experimented with
   several forecasting models coming from both machine-learning and
   deep-learning paradigms to predict wind speed in a metrological wind
   station located in East Jerusalem, Palestine. The wind speed data were
   obtained, modelled, and forecasted using six machine-learning
   techniques, namely Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), lasso regression,
   ridge regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), random forest, and
   deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Five variables were considered to
   develop the wind speed prediction models: timestamp, hourly wind speed,
   pressure, temperature, and direction. The performance of the models was
   evaluated using four statistical error measures: Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error
   (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). The experimental results
   demonstrated that the random forest followed by the LSMT-RNN
   outperformed the other techniques in terms of wind speed prediction
   accuracy for the study site.},

Abstract = {To mitigate uncertainties in wind resource assessments and to improve
   the estimation of energy production of a wind project, this work uses a
   decision tree machine learning model to assess the effectiveness of
   hub-height wind speed, rotor-equivalent wind speed, and lapse rate as

   regression trees and correlate the power outputs to wind profiles and
   meteorological characteristics to be able to predict power responses
   according to physical patterns. The decision tree model was trained for
   four vertical wind profile classifications to showcase the need for
   multiple calculations of wind speed at various levels of the rotor
   layer. Results indicate that when compared to traditional power curve
   methods, the decision tree combining rotor-equivalent wind speed and
   lapse rate improves prediction accuracy by 22\% for the given data-set,
   while also proving to be the most effective method in power prediction
   for all classified vertical wind profile types. Models incorporating
   lapse rate into predictions performed better than those without it,
   showing the importance of considering atmospheric criteria in wind power

Abstract = {The rapid growth of wind generation in northeast Brazil has led to
   multiple benefits to many different stakeholders of energy industry,
   especially because the wind is a renewable resource - an abundant and
   ubiquitous power source present in almost every state in the northeast
   region of Brazil. Despite the several benefits of wind power,
   forecasting the wind speed becomes a challenging task in practice, as it
   is highly volatile over time, especially when one has to deal with
   long-term predictions. Therefore, this paper focuses on applying
   different Machine Learning strategies such as Random Forest, Neural
   Networks and Gradient Boosting to perform regression on wind data for
   long periods of time. Three wind farms in the northeast Brazil have been
   investigated, whose data sets were constructed from the wind farms data
   collections and the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET).
   Statistical analyses of the wind data and the optimization of the
   trained predictors were conducted, as well as several quantitative
   assessments of the obtained forecast results.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY},

Abstract = {The unpredictability and instability of wind have hindered the
   development and utilization of wind power. To harness wind energy and
   ensure a secure and stable power grid after wind power integration,
   precise predictions of wind power generation are imperative. Here, we
   apply one-year data from a coastal wind farm in Zhejiang to train a
   Random Forest (RF) model for predicting wind power generation. The
   results indicate that the RF model (mean bias (MB) 1.33) outperforms
   traditional linear models (MB 87.70). An evaluation of
   prediction-measurement bias shows a strong agreement between the RF
   model's predictions and actual measurements (MB 1.33), especially when
   wind speeds exceed 5.7 m/s. While the Weather Research and Forecasting
   (WRF) model yields less accurate results (R2 0.65) compared to using
   measured wind velocity data (R2 0.97) for wind power prediction, it
   remains acceptable as it can capture and forecast peak generating power,
   meeting daily management requirements. Therefore, our machine
   learning-based approach offers practical guidance for reducing wind
   power generation uncertainties. Enhancing wind velocity forecasting
   through the WRF model could further improve the RF model's accuracy in
   predicting wind power generation. Our study also verified the future
   application of RF model in coastal areas of China.},

Abstract = {Wind power forecasting is a field characterised by sudden
   weather-related events, turbine failures and constraints imposed by the
   electricity grid. Nowadays, different energy markets add the extra
   challenge of requiring predictions at the minute level a day forward for
   bidding-processes. This is to avoid trading energy as a bulk and match
   demand. In this context, we present a novel approach to predict power
   generation at high frequencies one day in advance, which handles
   constraints such as curtailment and turbine degradation. This has been
   tested over historical data from SCADA systems and historical forecasts
   from wind speed providers for eight windfarm locations in Ireland over
   two years. Our work was performed in two phases. First, we undertook a
   preliminary study to analyse the relationship between all combinations
   of observed wind, forecasted wind and electrical power. Secondly, a wide
   variety of Machine Learning algorithms were run over each of the
   locations in order to assess the degrees of predictability of different
   algorithms and regions. Most of the algorithms benchmarked improve
   linear wind to power mappings besides the high degree of noise in this
   domain. Our analysis and experimental results show how boosting
   ensembles are a cost-effective solution in terms of runtime among other
   Machine Learning algorithms predicting wind power a day ahead. (c) 2022

Abstract = {To address foreseeable challenges during the penetration of wind energy
   into the power grid, including accurate wind power forecasting and smart
   power generation scheduling, this study proposes a novel short-term wind
   speed forecasting model, named EMD-KM-SXL, which is based on empirical
   mode decomposition (EMD), \$K \$ -means clustering and machine learning,
   and a new two-stage short-term wind power forecasting model based on
   wind speed forecasting and wind power curve (WPC) modeling. The former
   wind speed forecasting model regards historical wind speed observations
   as model input and the latter power forecasting model utilizes knowledge
   augmentation, introducing wind power conversion relationship,
   environmental factors as well as wind power system status parameters. In
   the proposed wind speed forecasting model, three machine learning
   models, including support vector regressor, XGBoost regressor, and Lasso
   regressor, are employed to forecast three types of frequency components
   that generated via EMD and \$K \$ -means clustering. Then, the WPC model
   is utilized to compute potential outpower based on wind speed prediction
   value speed, which is regarded as the first stage of the proposed wind
   power forecasting model. In the second stage, environmental factors and
   wind power system status parameters are introduced and an artificial
   neural network model, considering preliminary predicted power,
   environmental factors, and wind power system status parameters as model
   input is built to make final power prediction. Computational results

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) could be used to overcome one of the largest

   this research defined and evaluated the performance of seven ML
   supervised algorithms (regressions, decision tree, support vector
   machines, and an ensemble method) trained with meteorological mast data
   (temperature, humidity, wind direction, and wind speeds at 50 and 75 m),
   and mesoscale data below 80 m (from the New European Wind Atlas) to
   predict the WS at the height of 102 m. The results were compared with
   the conventional method used in wind energy assessments to vertically
   extrapolate the WS, the power law. It was proved that the ML models
   overcome the conventional method in terms of the prediction errors and
   the coefficient of determination. The main advantage of ML over the
   power-law was that ML performed the task using either only mesoscale
   data (described in scenario A), only data from the measurement mast
   (described in scenario B) or combining these two data sets (described in
   scenario C). The best ML models were the ensemble method in scenario A

Abstract = {Wind power is known as a major renewable and eco-friendly power
   generation source. As a clean and cost-effective energy source, wind
   power utilization has grown rapidly worldwide. A roof-mounted wind
   turbine is a wind power system that lowers energy transmission costs and
   benefits from wind power potential in urban areas. However, predicting
   wind power potential is a complex problem because of unpredictable wind
   patterns, particularly in urban areas. In this study, by using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and the concept of nondimensionality,
   with the help of machine learning techniques, we demonstrate a new
   method for predicting the wind power potential of a cluster of
   roof-mounted wind turbines over an actual urban area in Montreal,
   Canada. CFD simulations are achieved using city fast fluid dynamics
   (CityFFD), developed for urban microclimate simulations. The random
   forest model trains data generated by CityFFD for wind prediction. The
   accuracy of CityFFD is investigated by modeling an actual urban area and
   comparing the numerical data with measured data from a local weather

Abstract = {Wind energy is one of the rapidly developing renewable energies which is
   being developed and invested in response to climate change. As renewable
   energy policies and power plant installations are promoted, the supply
   of wind power in Korea is gradually expanding and attempts to accurately
   predict demand are expanding. In this paper, the ARIMA and ARIMAX models
   which are Time series techniques and the SVR, Random Forest and XGBoost
   models which are machine learning models were compared and analyzed to
   predict wind power generation in the Jeonnam and Gyeongbuk regions. Mean
   absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used
   as indicators to compare the predicted results of the model. After
   subtracting the hourly raw data from January 1, 2018 to October 24,
   2020, the model was trained to predict wind power generation for 168
   hours from October 25, 2020 to October 31, 2020. As a result of
   comparing the predictive power of the models, the Random Forest and
   XGBoost models showed the best performance in the order of Jeonnam and
   Gyeongbuk. In future research, we will try not only machine learning
   models but also forecasting wind power generation based on data mining
   techniques that have been actively researched recently.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a significant avenue for research in
   renewable energy, particularly in enhancing windmill performance,
   reducing wind energy costs, and mitigating risks in wind power. This
   article concentrates on leveraging IoT for assessing wind and solar
   energy, as well as estimating module lifespans. IoT has improved
   assessment methods, monitoring precision, and product testing,
   influencing power network reliability and inventory management in green
   energy. Predicting green energy output is crucial but challenging due to
   wind speed fluctuations. Machine learning (ML) techniques are applied to
   predict wind-based electricity output, with a comparative evaluation of
   forecasting methods. IoT technologies and algorithms enable energy
   consumption forecasts, yielding more accurate predictions and lower root
   mean square error (RMSE). Accurate meteorological forecasts are
   paramount in the green energy sector, necessitating predictive models
   for authentic wind generator data. The research aims to develop
   technologies for precise forecasts, with a focus on comprehensive wind
   forecast algorithms for photovoltaic systems. Various ML techniques and
   green energy prediction software are assessed for their accuracy in this

Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},

Volume = {7},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wind speed prediction could play an important role in improving the
   performance of wind turbine control and condition monitoring. For
   example, by predicting or forecasting the upcoming wind in advance,
   fluctuations in wind power output in above rated wind speed could be
   reduced without causing an increase in pitch activity, and anomalies
   such as an extreme gust could be detected before it reaches the wind
   turbine, allowing appropriate control actions to take place to minimise
   any potential damage that could be incurred by the anomalies. A novel
   wind speed prediction scheme is presented in this paper that comprises
   mainly two stages, estimation and prediction. Estimation is first
   carried out using an Extended Kalman filter, which is designed based on
   a 3 dimensional wind field model and a nonlinear rotor model. Prediction
   is subsequently performed in two steps, extrapolation and machine
   learning. The wind speed prediction scheme is tested using data obtained
   from a high-fidelity aeroelastic model. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Wind energy has become a trend in Brazil, particularly in the
   northeastern region of the country. Despite its advantages, wind power
   generation has been hindered by the high volatility of exogenous
   factors, such as weather, temperature, and air humidity, making
   long-term forecasting a highly challenging task. Another issue is the
   need for reliable solutions, especially for large-scale wind farms, as
   this involves integrating specific optimization tools and
   restricted-access datasets collected locally at the power plants.
   Therefore, in this paper, the problem of forecasting the energy
   generated at the Praia Formosa wind farm, an eco-friendly park located
   in the state of Ceara, Brazil, which produces around 7\% of the state's
   electricity, was addressed. To proceed with our data-driven analysis,
   publicly available data were collected from multiple Brazilian official
   sources, combining them into a unified database to perform exploratory
   data analysis and predictive modeling. Specifically, three
   machine-learning-based approaches were applied: Extreme Gradient
   Boosting, Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory Network, as well as
   feature-engineering strategies to enhance the precision of the machine
   intelligence models, including creating artificial features and tuning
   the hyperparameters. Our findings revealed that all implemented models
   successfully captured the energy-generation trends, patterns, and
   seasonality from the complex wind data. However, it was found that the
   LSTM-based model consistently outperformed the others, achieving a
   promising global MAPE of 4.55\%, highlighting its accuracy in long-term
   wind energy forecasting. Temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed
   were identified as the key factors influencing electricity production,
   with peak generation typically occurring from August to November.},

Abstract = {Background With the gradual construction of new power systems, new
   energy sources, such as wind and photovoltaic power, will gradually
   dominate positions in the power supply structure, directly leading the
   new power system to rely heavily on accurate meteorological forecasts.
   High-precision and high-resolution meteorological forecasts are
   important technical methods to improve the safe, stable, and economic
   operation of the new power system.Objective Since the analysis of
   meteorological elements is the basis of meteorological forecasting, in
   this paper, the effect of different meteorological elements including
   temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed, wind
   direction, and radiation on the performance of power forecasting, was
   analyzed by using 7 machine learning algorithms in 5 provinces in
   southern China.Methods About 5 provinces in southern China were selected
   as the research objects, and 7 typical machine learning algorithms were
   applied and compared, including support vector machine (SVM), decision
   tree (DT), random forest (RFR), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Linear
   Regression (LR), Ridge Regression (RR), and Lasso Regression (Lasso R).
   At the same time, the influence of different meteorological elements,
   such as temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, wind speed, wind
   direction, and radiation amount, on the prediction performance of wind
   power and photovoltaic power was considered. Then, the performance of
   different regression models was further investigated and
   analyzed.Results Based on the data of 10 new energy stations in 5
   regions, the research on the prediction performance of 7 machine
   learning methods shows that the performance of models in different
   regions varies greatly. Among the 10 selected new energy stations, the
   RFR model and KNR model have superior overall performance.Conclusion
   This study shows how variable importance and prediction accuracy depend
   on regression methods and climatic variables, providing effective
   methods to assess the interdependence of meteorological variables and
   the importance of meteorological variables in predicting output power.},

   Using Recurrent Neural Networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In recent years, Taiwan has actively pursued the development of
   renewable energy, with offshore wind power assessments indicating that
   80\% of the world's best wind fields are located in the western seas of
   Taiwan. The aim of this study is to maximize offshore wind power
   generation and develop a method for predicting offshore wind power,
   thereby exploring the potential of offshore wind power in Taiwan. The
   research employs machine learning techniques to establish a wind speed
   prediction model and formulates a real-time wind power potential
   assessment method. The study utilizes long short-term memory networks
   (LSTM), gated recurrent units, and stacked recurrent neural networks
   with LSTM units as the architecture for the wind speed prediction model.
   Furthermore, the prediction models are categorized into annual and
   seasonal patterns based on the seasonal characteristics of the wind. The
   research evaluates the optimal model by analyzing the results of the two
   patterns to predict the power generation conditions for 1 to 12 h. The
   study region includes offshore areas near Hsinchu and Kaohsiung in
   Taiwan. The novelty of the study lies in the systematic analysis using
   multiple sets of wind turbines, covering aspects such as wind power
   potential assessment, wind speed prediction, and fixed and floating wind
   turbine considerations. The research comprehensively considers the
   impact of different offshore locations, turbine hub heights, rotor-swept
   areas, and wind field energy on power generation. Ultimately, based on
   the research findings, it is recommended to choose the SG 8.0-167 DD
   wind turbine system for the Hsinchu offshore area and the SG 6.0-154
   wind turbine system for the Kaohsiung offshore area, serving as
   reference cases for wind turbine selection.},

Abstract = {Wind energy is a green source of electricity that is growing faster than

   source is characterized by the randomness and fluctuation that makes
   challenging optimal management. In order to remedy this inconvenience,

   based on regularized extreme learning machine algorithm (R-ELM),
   particle swarm optimization method (PSO), and AutoEncoder network (AE)
   so-called AutoEncoder-optimal regularized extreme learning machine
   (AE-ORELM). Firstly, we train the AE model by the ELM algorithm. Then,
   the output weights resulting are used as the input weights of the R-ELM
   model. Furthermore, the PSO method is used to optimally select
   hyperparameters of the whole model, namely the regularization parameter
   and the number of hidden nodes in the hidden layer. The simulation
   results show that the proposed AE-ORELM can achieve better testing
   accuracy with a faster training time compared to related models.},

Abstract = {The electrical energy demand is growing every day. Fossil fuel-based
   electrical power generation pollutes the environment. So, to fulfil the
   electrical energy demand, clean renewable energy sources like solar and
   wind are emerging as viable alternatives. But the amount of power
   generated from solar and wind energy sources is varying in magnitude and
   is intermittent in nature. So, predicting solar and wind power
   generation is indispensable for efficient planning and controlling of a
   renewable energy system. This paper aims to identify a machine learning
   model suitable for time-series prediction of wind power and also surveys
   the predominantly existing machine learning followed by the deep
   learning approaches. The main objective of this study is to solve a
   real-life problem in the renewable energy sector by accurately
   estimating the amount of power generation production per hour by
   applying machine learning techniques using historical wind power energy
   production data. Hence, historical wind data set with input parameters
   like wind speed, wind direction air temperature, pressure, and output
   parameters of wind power generation is considered for training and
   testing using mean absolute error for evaluating the prediction
   accuracy. Layers from simple to complex deep layers are trained and
   tested for prediction accuracy, i.e. baseline, linear, dense,
   multidense, convolution neural networks, and long short-term memory.
   Investigating further, LSTM and Residual LSTM prove to have higher mean
   absolute prediction accuracy of 0.0987 and 0.0958. This eventually
   enlightens the wind power forecasting models and new paths for further
   research applications.},

   first variable selection using both a linear technique and a nonlinear

Title = {A novel hybrid machine learning model for short-term wind speed
   prediction in inner Mongolia, China},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},

Abstract = {Wind power is recognized as one of the most promising renewable and
   clean energy sources under the context of the increasing depletion of
   fossil fuels. The exact wind speed forecasting has great significance
   for the large-scale connection of wind farms with the power grid. In
   light of this, this paper contributes to establishing a novel hybrid
   model that can predict the future wind speed accurately. Firstly, the
   original wind speed time series is decomposed by the fast ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition into several sub-series that are further
   integrated by the runs test. The phase space reconstruction is used to
   dynamically choose each integrated sub-series' input and output vectors
   for the prediction model. Additionally, an improved whale optimization
   algorithm is exploited to optimize the weights and bias of the extreme
   learning machine. Finally, prediction results are obtained from the
   aggregation of each integrated sub-series prediction. To verify the
   accuracy and applicability of the proposed hybrid model, we apply
   several comparative models to conducted two case studies using different
   wind speed time series from Inner Mongolia that is Asia's largest
   gathering area of wind power farms. According to the experimental
   results, it can be concluded that the decomposition reduces the
   volatility and randomness of wind speed, and the runs test lowers the
   forecasting complexity. The phase space reconstruction can capture the
   chaotic property of wind speed series. The optimization for the whale
   optimization algorithm enhances its global and local optimization
   ability to further improve the performance of extreme learning machine.
   Overall, the proposed hybrid model can effectively capture the
   non-linear charac-teristics of wind speed series. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Wind speed (WS) prediction has become popular nowadays due to increasing
   demand for wind power generation and competitive development in wind
   energy. Many prediction models are used to predict WS for which wind is
   non-stationary, nonlinear and irregular. However, they neglect the
   effectiveness of feature selection methods in WS prediction, thereby
   creating very challenging for precise prediction of WS and safe
   operation of the wind industry. To overpower these challenges and
   further improve WS prediction accuracy, a prediction model is developed
   based on feature selection technique and prediction models. Therefore
   this study proposes an adaptive self-learning wind speed (WS) predicting
   model using fuzzy reinforcement learning (FRL) that is Fuzzy Q Learning
   (FQL). Proposed FQL based WS predictor model can predict with great
   accuracy. This is a first effort at developing a forecasting model using
   FRL for WS prediction. The presented model has no prior knowledge of the
   system or plant or target speed information. Measured WS is processed
   through Info Gain attribute evaluator with Ranker search method feature
   selection purpose which serves as input to the FQL based WS prediction
   model. The comparison of proposed prediction method and existing machine
   learning based is carried out using simulations. The performance
   analysis indicates that the proposed method serves as an important tool

Abstract = {Wind speed prediction has an important impact on the planning, economic
   operation and safe maintenance of wind power systems. However, the high
   volatility and intermittency of wind speed make it difficult to predict
   accurately. To improve the prediction accuracy, we developed a hybrid
   multistep wind speed prediction model named EWP-CS-RELM. In this model,
   a secondary decomposition technique of ensemble empirical mode
   decomposition (EEMD) and wavelet packet transform (WPT) is used, and it
   is called the EWP decomposition technique. This decomposition technique
   can achieve an adaptive processing of the data and accurately extract
   the characteristic components of the signal, avoiding the occurrence of
   pattern overlap and reducing the mutual interference between components.
   At the same time, the high and low-frequency parts of the complex signal
   (component) can be decomposed into different frequency bands, and the
   corresponding frequency band can be selected adaptively to match the
   signal spectrum. The subsequence obtained after EWP decomposition is
   then predicted using a regularised extreme learning machine (RELM)
   optimised by the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm with strong global search
   ability to obtain the results. The hybrid prediction model is validated
   using four seasons of wind speed data from two wind farms in Shandong,
   China, and compared with seven other prediction models. Simulation
   results illustrate that the EWP-CS-RELM model outperforms the other
   seven models with the smallest statistical errors.},

Title = {A hybrid Extreme Learning Machine model with Levy flight Chaotic Whale
   Optimization Algorithm for Wind Speed Forecasting},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Efficient and accurate prediction of renewable energy sources (RES) is
   an interminable challenge in efforts to assure the stable and safe
   operation of any hybrid energy system due to its intermittent nature.
   High integration of RES especially wind energy into the existing power
   sector in recent years has made the situation still chal-lenging which
   draws the attention of many researchers in developing a computationally
   efficient forecast model for accurately predicting RES. With the advent
   of Neural network based methods, ELM-Extreme Learning Ma-chine, a
   typical Single Layer Feedforward Network (SLFFN), has gained a
   significant attention in recent years in solving various real-time
   complex problems due to simplified architecture, good generalization
   capabilities and fast computation. However, since the model parameters
   are randomly assigned, the conventional ELM is frequently ranked as the
   second-best model. As a solution, the article attempts to construct a
   unique optimized Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based forecast model
   with improved accuracy for wind speed forecasting. A novel swarm
   intelligence technique-Le \& PRIME;vy flight Chaotic Whale Optimization
   algorithm (LCWOA) is utilized in the hybrid model to optimize different
   parameters of ELM. Despite having a appropriate convergence rate, WOA is
   occasionally unable to discover the global optima due to imbalanced
   exploration and exploitation when using control parameters with linear
   variation. An improvement in the convergence rate of WOA can be expected
   by incorporating chaotic maps in the control parameters of WOA due to
   their ergodic nature. In addition to this, Le \& PRIME;vy flight can
   significantly improve the intensification and diversification of the
   Whale Optimization algorithm (WOA) resulting in improvised search
   ability avoiding local minima. The prediction capability of the
   suggested hybrid Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based forecast model is
   validated with nine other existing models. The experimental study
   affirms that the suggested model outperform existing forecasting methods
   in a variety of quantitative metrics.},

Abstract = {The development and deployment of an effective wind speed forecasting
   technology can improve the safety and stability of power systems with
   significant wind penetration. Due to the wind's unpredictable and
   unstable qualities, accurate forecasting of wind speed and power is
   extremely challenging. Several algorithms were proposed for this purpose
   to improve the level of forecasting reliability. The Long Short-Term
   Memory (LSTM) network is a common method for making predictions based on
   time series data. This paper proposed a machine learning algorithm,
   called Adaptive Dynamic Particle Swarm Algorithm (AD-PSO) combined with
   Guided Whale Optimization Algorithm (Guided WOA), for wind speed
   ensemble forecasting. The AD-PSO-Guided WOA algorithm selects the
   optimal hyperparameters value of the LSTM deep learning model for
   forecasting of wind speed. In experiments, a wind power forecasting
   dataset is employed to predict hourly power generation up to forty-eight
   hours ahead at seven wind farms. This case study is taken from the
   Kaggle Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 in wind forecasting.
   The results demonstrated that the AD-PSO-Guided WOA algorithm provides
   high accuracy and outperforms several comparative optimization and deep
   learning algorithms. Different tests' statistical analysis, including
   Wilcoxon's rank-sum and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), confirms
   the accuracy of the presented algorithm.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {14184-14194},
Abstract = {Wind turbines are one of the primary sources of renewable energy, which
   leads to a sustainable and efficient energy solution. It does not
   release any carbon emissions to pollute our planet. The wind farms
   monitoring and power generation prediction is a complex problem due to
   the unpredictability of wind speed. Consequently, it limits the decision
   power of the management team to plan the energy consumption in an
   effective way. Our proposed model solves this challenge by utilizing a
   5G-Next Generation-Radio Access Network (5G-NG-RAN) assisted cloud-based
   digital twins' framework to virtually monitor wind turbines and form a
   predictive model to forecast wind speed and predict the generated power.
   The developed model is based on Microsoft Azure digital twins
   infrastructure as a 5-dimensional digital twins platform. The predictive
   modeling is based on a deep learning approach, temporal convolution
   network (TCN) followed by a non-parametric k-nearest neighbor (kNN)
   regression. Predictive modeling has two components. First, it processes
   the univariate time series data of wind to predict its speed. Secondly,
   it estimates the power generation for each quarter of the year ranges
   from one week to a whole month (i.e., medium-term prediction) To
   evaluate the framework the experiments are performed on onshore wind
   turbines publicly available datasets. The obtained results confirm the
   applicability of the proposed framework. Furthermore, the comparative
   analysis with the existing classical prediction models shows that our
   designed approach obtained better results. The model can assist the
   management team to monitor the wind farms remotely as well as estimate
   the power generation in advance.},

Abstract = {This study proposes a cost-effective machine-learning based model for
   predicting velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields in the wake of
   wind turbines for yaw control applications. The model consists of an
   auto-encoder convolutional neural network (ACNN) trained to extract the
   features of turbine wakes using instantaneous data from large-eddy
   simulation (LES). The proposed framework is demonstrated by applying it
   to the Sandia National Laboratory Scaled Wind Farm Technology facility
   consisting of three 225 kW turbines. LES of this site is performed for
   different wind speeds and yaw angles to generate datasets for training
   and validating the proposed ACNN. It is shown that the ACNN accurately
   predicts turbine wake characteristics for cases with turbine yaw angle
   and wind speed that were not part of the training process. Specifically,
   the ACNN is shown to reproduce the wake redirection of the upstream
   turbine and the secondary wake steering of the downstream turbine
   accurately. Compared to the brute-force LES, the ACNN developed herein
   is shown to reduce the overall computational cost required to obtain the
   steady state first and second-order statistics of the wind farm by about
   85\%.},

Title = {A Survey of Machine Learning Applications in Renewable Energy Sources},
Journal = {IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 NOV 17},
Abstract = {Renewable energy is now in high demand due to the deterioration of the
   global climate and the depletion of conventional sources. Renewable
   energy sources (RES) such as wind and solar are extremely intermittent,
   making it impossible to sustain system reliability with an unacceptably
   high proportion of renewable energy injection. An intrinsic attribute
   common to all renewable power plants is that the production of energy
   relies on environmental conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind
   speed, humidity, clouds, etc. Therefore, the power from RES cannot be
   completely regulated or pre-planned. It is important to forecast the
   amount of electricity that can be produced in a power grid for future
   demand. Machine learning (ML) is an emerging technology and used in all
   fields nowadays to perform different tasks. In this paper, the
   applications of machine learning in renewable energy sources are
   discussed. These ML techniques are mainly used to predict the power from
   renewable energy sources like wind, solar, hydro, biomass, tidal, and
   geothermal. Fault detection is a significant aspect in renewable energy
   systems to reduce the operation and maintenance cost and to deliver the
   continuous power to the loads. This paper also focusses on the use of ML
   techniques in predicting the faults before it occurs, early detection of
   faults and also to diagnose the faults in renewable energy systems.
   Along with the above-mentioned applications, these ML techniques used in
   RES for different purposes are also discussed.},

Abstract = {Environmental parameter consideration has always prompted wind power to

   energy integration to the power grid due to wind intermittency. Wind
   speed or wind power forecasting is one of the approach to manage this

   in terms of measurements of correlation factors and Mean Absolute Error
   values. The predicted wind speed value is further considered for the
   power generation from the wind farm and integrated to the distribution
   system. Load Impedance Matrix method is implemented for Distribution
   System Load Flow analysis for being robust and simple with single-step

Abstract = {Wind energy is the burgeoning renewable energy. Accurate wind speed
   prediction is necessary to ensure the stability and reliability of the

   hybrid forecasting model to tackle adverse effects caused by strong
   variability and abrupt changes in wind speed. The hybrid model combines
   data decomposition and error correction strategy for a wind speed
   forecasting model applied to wind energy. First, wavelet packet
   decomposition is applied to wind speed series to obtain stationary
   subseries. Next, outlier robust extreme learning machine is implemented
   to predict subseries. Finally, an error correction strategy coupled with
   data decomposition is designed to repair preliminary prediction results.
   In addition, four measured datasets from China and USA wind farms with
   different time intervals are used to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed approach. Experimental analysis indicates that the proposed
   model outperforms the compared models. Results show that (1) the
   prediction accuracy of the proposed model is remarkably improved

Abstract = {Wind fields are intermittent and nonlinear to meteorological factors and
   external environmental conditions. Statistical models have been proposed
   based on various approaches to precisely predict wind speed and energy
   production. However, determining the most suitable approach is
   challenging, regardless of the conditions. Currently, only wind speed,
   wind direction, temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity have
   been used as input features of models in most wind-power forecasting
   studies. However, few studies have described each feature's contribution
   to prediction performance when using meteorological factors, such as
   atmospheric stability and turbulence components, as input features. This
   study predicted the 10 min average power and daily energy production of
   a wind farm using four machine learning (ML) algorithms and 13
   meteorological factors. The ultimate goal was to present the individual
   prediction contribution of meteorological factors using the Shapley
   additive explanations algorithm, which is an explainable artificial
   intelligence technique, based on the prediction results. Wind speed
   showed a dominant influence in the determination of energy production,
   followed by turbulent kinetic energy, turbulence intensity, and
   turbulence dissipation rate. Thus, insights into the detailed
   contribution of turbulence components to predict the performance
   facilitate the advancement of ML-based approaches, which can yield
   significant benefits in increasing the predictability of actual wind
   energy, thereby ensuring efficiency and stability in wind farm
   operations.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the global wind power construction is accelerating.
   Although wind power is a clean energy without pollution, its volatility
   and irregularity have a great impact on wind power integration.
   Therefore, scholars pay more and more attention to the ultra-short-term
   prediction of wind speed. At present, the popular wind speed prediction
   model usually combines wind speed decomposition algorithm, machine
   learning algorithm, and intelligent optimization algorithm. The general
   wind speed decomposition algorithm cannot use the information contained
   in the factors affecting wind speed. Besides, the current popular
   optimization algorithms, such as gray wolf optimization algorithm, have
   strong convergence and better optimization effect, but their structure
   is complex and their operation complexity is large. And the PSO
   algorithm has simple structure and fast operation speed. To solve the
   above problems, a novel combination prediction model is proposed in this
   paper. This model uses VMD to decompose the wind speed into
   high-frequency signal and low-frequency signal and then uses principal
   component analysis and spectral clustering to extract and classify the
   influencing factors. In addition, aiming at the problem of slow
   convergence speed in the later stage of PSO iteration, an adaptive
   improved PSO is proposed. Finally, this paper also designs a rolling
   train method to adjust the size of training samples. Through four
   experiments of wind speed series in two periods, it is proved that the
   combined prediction model proposed in this paper has the following
   advantages: the model fully extracts the information of wind speed and
   influencing factors; the improved PSO algorithm has better optimization
   effect; rolling training method effectively improves the prediction
   ability of the model; the combined forecasting model has good
   adaptability and competitiveness.},

Title = {Comparison of machine learning models for performance evaluation of
   wind-induced vibration piezoelectric energy harvester with fin-shaped
   attachments},
Journal = {OCEAN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {280},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Three machine learning models are applied to estimate output voltage of
   the wind-induced vibration piezo-electric energy harvester (WIVPEH) in
   this paper. The dataset for machine learning model is from the wind
   tunnel experiment. The wind speed ranged from 1.02 m/s to 6.80 m/s. The
   fin-shaped attachments (FSAs) are fixed on the cylinder of the WIVPEH.
   The installation angle and coverage of FSAs are in the range of 0 <=
   theta <= 160 degrees and 20 degrees <= alpha <= 50 degrees. The range of
   FSA-height is H = 0.2D -0.4D. The results show that the amplitude ratio
   of the FSA-cylinder first increases and then decreases with the increase
   of FSA-height. The maximum amplitude reaches 2.3D at U = 6.8 m/s and H =
   0.33D. The FSAs enhance energy extracting performance of the WIVPEH. The
   maximum output power of the WIVPEH with FSAs reaches 1.87 mW at H =
   0.33D and U = 6.8 m/s, which is 49.21 times that of the harvester with
   smooth cylinder. The GBRT model with optimal parameters has the best
   performance for predicting output voltage of the WIVPEH with FSAs on the
   test dataset.},

Title = {Utilizing physics-based input features within a machine learning model
   to predict wind speed forecasting error},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Pages = {295-309},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Machine learning is quickly becoming a commonly used technique for wind
   speed and power forecasting. Many machine learning methods utilize
   exogenous variables as input features, but there remains the question of
   which atmospheric variables are most beneficial for forecasting,
   especially in handling non-linearities that lead to forecasting error.
   This question is addressed via creation of a hybrid model that utilizes
   an autoregressive integrated moving-average (ARIMA) model to make an
   initial wind speed forecast followed by a random forest model that
   attempts to predict the ARIMA forecasting error using knowledge of
   exogenous atmospheric variables. Variables conveying information about
   atmospheric stability and turbulence as well as inertial forcing are
   found to be useful in dealing with non-linear error prediction.
   Streamwise wind speed, time of day, turbulence intensity, turbulent heat
   flux, vertical velocity, and wind direction are found to be particularly
   useful when used in unison for hourly and 3 h timescales. The prediction
   accuracy of the developed ARIMA-random forest hybrid model is compared
   to that of the persistence and bias-corrected ARIMA models. The
   ARIMA-random forest model is shown to improve upon the latter commonly
   employed modeling methods, reducing hourly forecasting error by up to
   5\% below that of the bias-corrected ARIMA model and achieving an R-2
   value of 0.84 with true wind speed.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the development of statistical, machine learning,
   and hybrid models to predict the wind energy generation of a major wind
   farm in Sri Lanka named Nala Danavi. Regression based statistical
   techniques, namely, Multiple Linear Regression and Power Regression were
   applied to the input variables of wind speed and ambient temperature
   producing expressions for wind energy in terms of those weather indices.
   Similarly, the machine learning techniques of Support Vector Regression
   and Artificial Neural Network were applied in developing another set of
   wind energy prediction models. Unlike in the methods mentioned above,
   the Support Vector Machine was applied only to the past energy data. In
   contrast, a Vector Error Correction model was developed by using both
   wind energy and weather data. Further, time series modelling of wind
   energy data was performed to develop a Seasonal Autoregressive
   Integrated Moving Average model. The research was further extended to
   develop two hybrid prediction models by combining Support Vector Machine
   and Artificial Neural Network each with Seasonal Autoregressive
   Integrated Moving Average. The performance of all the models was
   assessed and compared in terms of the Coefficient of Determination, Root
   Mean Square Error, and the Mean Absolute Error. As per the results, all
   the models were highly accurate while the Support Vector Regression
   produced the most precise prediction model. The models developed in this
   research can be used to predict the wind energy generated at Nala Danavi
   wind farm using either the previous energy data or the projected weather
   data of the region.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Renewable energy has taken a center stage in sustainable and
   environmentally safe power generation. In this work, a novel model free
   Reinforcement Learning based wind speed forecasting technique has been
   proposed. Our technique uses modified fuzzy Q learning (MFQL) framework
   to accurately predict 1-min ahead wind speed from the publicly available
   data online. Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Pearson's
   correlation coefficient have been used in the pre-processing stages to
   identify seven most relevant intrinsic mode functions (IMF) from the raw
   wind speed data. These IMFs form the inputs to an MFQL based forecaster
   which accurately forecasts wind speed using a reward/punishment
   approach. MFQL predictor is put to test on wind speed data obtained from
   National Institute of Wind Energy and Wind Resource Assessment data
   portal for 10 Indian cities, i.e., Bhogat, Chandori, Kotada, Charanka,
   Gandhi Nagar, Jambua, Keshod, Sadodar, Surat and Vartej located in the
   state of Gujarat, India. Our predictor is able to achieve an accuracy of
   96.23\% for Gandhi Nagar, 94.84\% for Bhogat, 94.12\% for Kotada and
   similar results are obtained for other locations. MFQL approach has been
   compared with SVR and k-NN. Results show that MFQL approach has higher
   accuracy than SVR and k-NN techniques.},

Title = {Enhancing wind speed forecasting through synergy of machine learning,

Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Due to technological advancements, wind energy has emerged as a
   prominent renewable power source. However, the intermittent nature of
   wind poses challenges in accurately predicting wind speeds, affecting
   the operation of electric systems. With the Brazilian electricity market
   transition to hourly electricity pricing, there is a growing need for
   forecasting tools to enhance wind farm operation and maintenance
   schedules. To address this issue, this research explores the performance
   of forecasting models enhanced with a decomposition stage to mitigate
   wind speed forecast errors. The study considers two decomposition
   techniques: singular spectral analysis in the time domain and
   variational mode decomposition in the frequency domain, combined in a
   hybrid structure incorporating multi -stage decomposition and time
   series prediction. The study focuses on hourly forecasting horizons of
   24, 48, and 72 steps ahead. The autoregressive recurrent neural network
   achieved a MAPE of 10.92\% utilizing decomposition for the 72 -hour
   forecast from January to December 2015, this represents a 51.16\%
   improvement compared to the original structure. The outcomes of all the
   assessed models employing decomposition demonstrate a decrease in error
   in comparison to those without decomposition, thereby confirming the
   potential of hybrid architectures. Forecasting approaches can contribute
   to improved wind farm operation planning and maintenance scheduling.},

Abstract = {With the large-scale integration of wind power into the power grid,
   improving the wind speed prediction accuracy is of great significance
   for promoting the consumption of renewable energy. In this paper, a
   hybrid prediction method for multi-step wind speed prediction based on
   the empirical wavelet transform (EWT), multi-objective modified seagull

   machine (MKELM) is proposed. First, EWT is used to decompose the
   nonstationary wind speed data into a set of stationary subsequences.
   Then, each subsequence of wind speed is predicted by the MKELM, and the
   MKELM network is optimized by the MOMSOA newly proposed in this study.
   Finally, the inverse empirical wavelet transform (IEWT) is adopted to
   reconstruct the prediction results into the final wind speed prediction
   results. To assess the performance of the proposed combined model, four
   groups of experiments are carried out on four wind speed sequences, and
   a comparative analysis is made with 16 comparison models. The models
   involved in the investigation are discussed comprehensively in terms of
   significance and stability. The results demonstrate that the developed

Abstract = {With the increase in the penetration rate of renewable energy sources, a
   machine-learning-based forecasting system has been introduced to the
   grid sector to improve the participation rate in the electricity market
   and reduce energy losses. In these studies, correlation analysis of
   mechanical and environmental variables, including geographical figures,
   is considered a crucial point to increase the prediction's accuracy.
   Various models have been applied in terms of accuracy, speed
   calculation, and amount of data based on a mathematical model that can
   calculate the wake; however, it can be difficult to derive variables
   such as air density, roughness length, and the effect of turbulence on
   the structural characteristics of wind turbines. Furthermore, wake
   accuracy could decrease due to the excessive variables that come from
   the wake effect parameters. In this paper, we intend to conduct research
   to improve prediction accuracy by considering the wake effect of wind
   turbines using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data
   from the Dongbok wind farm. The wake divides the wind direction into
   four parts and then recognizes and predicts the affected wind turbine.
   The predicted result is the wake wind speed and its conversion to power
   generation by applying a power curve. We try to show the efficiency of
   machine learning by comparing the wake wind speed and the power
   generation in the wake model. This result shows the error rate using
   evaluation metrics of regression, such as mean squared error (MSE), root
   mean squared error (RMSE), and weighted absolute percentage error
   (WAPE), and attempts to verify power system impact and efficiency
   through a real-time digital simulator (RTDS).},

Abstract = {Wind power prediction contributes to clean energy utilization and grid
   dispatching. In this study, a wind power prediction model based on
   outlier correction, ensemble reinforcement learning, and residual
   correction is proposed. Firstly, the Hampel identifier (HI) is utilized
   to correct outliers in the original data. Then group method of data
   handling, echo state network, and extreme learning machine are selected
   as three base learners to predict the corrected wind power data. And the
   ensemble reinforcement learning algorithm based on the Q-learning
   algorithm is utilized to generate optimal ensemble weights to combine
   the prediction results of three base learners. Finally, the residual
   correction method (RCM) is applied to revise the prediction results, to
   obtain the final forecasting results. By comparing the experimental
   results of the relevant models for four real wind power datasets, it can
   be known that: (a) The use of both HI and RCM is beneficial to enhance
   the model's prediction accuracy. (b) The proposed ensemble method based
   on the Q-learning algorithm has superiority and can achieve smaller
   prediction errors than three classic ensemble algorithms. (c) The wind

Abstract = {Recently, wind power plants that generate wind energy with electricity
   are attracting a lot of attention thanks to their smaller installation
   area and cheaper power generation costs. In wind power generation, it is
   important to predict the amount of generated electricity because the
   power system would be unstable due to uncertainty in supply. However, it
   is difficult to accurately predict the amount of wind power generation
   because the power varies due to several causes, such as wind speed, wind
   direction, temperature, etc. In this study, we deal with a mid-term (one
   day ahead) wind power forecasting problem with a data-driven approach.
   In particular, it is intended to solve the problem of a newly completed
   wind power generator that makes it very difficult to predict the amount
   of electricity generated due to the lack of data on past power
   generation. To this end, a deep learning based transfer learning model
   was proposed and compared with other models, such as a deep learning
   model without transfer learning and Light Gradient Boosting Machine
   (LGBM). As per the experimental results, when the proposed transfer
   learning model was applied to a similar wind power complex in the same
   region, it was confirmed that the low predictive performance of the
   newly constructed generator could be supplemented.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the importance of renewable energy is rapidly increasing. It
   is considered as an alternative clean source of energy due to

   model to predict the generated electrical power based on wind energy and

   collected every 15 min in a wide, open space area located in southeast
   Palestine. To investigate and validate the correctness and robustness of
   the work, three different scenarios were performed for each season to
   predict wind speed and direction, and mechanical power. Also, different
   performance metrics were applied. The results were very promising with
   an average error of less than 3\% and an R-Squared value of 0.95. Since
   the price of electricity in Palestine is relatively high, the results
   showed also the possibility to generate electricity with lowered price
   of about 40\% and a reasonable payback period of 11 years. The work
   confirms that wind energy is cost-effective and a good alternative to

Abstract = {Leveraging multiple heterogeneous measurements to predict wind power has
   long been a challenging task in the electrical community. In this paper,
   a deep architecture incorporated with multitask learning and multimodal
   learning for wind power prediction, termed predictive stacked
   autoencoder (PSAE), is presented. PSAE is a unified framework
   integrating multiple stacked autoencoders (SAEs), one feature fusion
   layer, and one prediction terminal layer, which expands the architecture
   from two spatial dimensions, including the depth and width, compared to
   conventional prediction models. Initially, the SAEs at the bottom of
   PSAE extracted features from multiple kinds of measurements
   respectively. Following, the feature fusion layer encodes the high-order
   features extracted by different SAEs into a unified feature that is more
   informative and representative for wind power prediction. Finally, the
   prediction terminal layer functions as a regression machine which
   generates the predicted targets based on the fusion features. Trained in
   an end-to-end (E2E) manner, PSAE is capable of learning heterogeneous
   features jointly and achieving the prediction task of
   sequence-to-sequence (S2S). Experiments for multi-step short-term
   predictions are conducted on real-world data, and the results

Title = {A Novel Hybrid Model Based on an Improved Seagull Optimization Algorithm
   for Short-Term Wind Speed Forecasting},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Wind energy is a clean energy source and is receiving widespread
   attention. Improving the operating efficiency and economic benefits of
   wind power generation systems depends on more accurate short-term wind
   speed predictions. In this study, a new hybrid model for short-term wind
   speed forecasting is proposed. The model combines variational modal
   decomposition (VMD), the proposed improved seagull optimization
   algorithm (ISOA) and the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) network.
   The model adopts a hybrid modeling strategy: firstly, VMD decomposition
   is used to decompose the wind speed time series into several wind speed
   subseries. Secondly, KELM optimized by ISOA is used to predict each
   decomposed subseries. The ISOA technique is employed to accurately find
   the best parameters in each KELM network such that the predictability of
   a single KELM model can be enhanced. Finally, the prediction results of
   the wind speed sublayer are summarized to obtain the original wind
   speed. This hybrid model effectively characterizes the nonlinear and
   nonstationary characteristics of wind speed and greatly improves the
   forecasting performance. The experiment results demonstrate that: (1)
   the proposed VMD-ISOA-KELM model obtains the best performance for the
   application of three different prediction horizons compared with the
   other classic individual models, and (2) the proposed hybrid model
   combining the VMD technique and ISOA optimization algorithm performs
   better than models using other data preprocessing techniques.},

Abstract = {Clean energy has become an increasingly important consideration in
   today's power systems. As the push for clean energy continues, many
   coal-fired power plants are being decommissioned in favor of renewable
   power sources such as wind and solar. However, the intermittent nature
   of renewables means that dynamic load following traditional power
   systems is crucial to grid stability. With high flexibility and fast
   response at a wide range of operating conditions, gas turbine systems
   are poised to become the main load following component in the power
   grid. Yet, rapid changes in load can lead to fluid flow instabilities in
   gas turbine power systems. These instabilities often lead to compressor
   surge and stall, which are some of the most critical problems facing the
   safe and efficient operation of compressors in turbomachinery today.
   Although the topic of compressor surge and stall has been extensively
   researched, no methods for early prediction have been proven effective.
   This study explores the utilization of machine learning tools to predict
   compressor stall. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a form of
   recurrent neural network (RNN), was trained using real compressor stall
   datasets from a 100 kW recuperated gas turbine power system designed for
   hybrid configuration. Two variations of the LSTM model, classification
   and regression, were tested to determine optimal performance. The
   regression scheme was determined to be the most accurate approach, and a
   tool for predicting compressor stall was developed using this
   configuration. Results show that the tool is capable of predicting
   stalls 5-20 ms before they occur. With a high-speed controller capable
   of 5 ms time-steps, mitigating action could be taken to prevent
   compressor stall before it occurs.},

Abstract = {The variability of power production from renewable energy sources (RESs)
   presents serious challenges in energy management (EM) and power system
   stability. Power forecasting plays a crucial role in optimal EM and grid

   temperature, and atmospheric pressure, are fed to the model as inputs.
   The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and normalized mean

   technique. The performance of ANN was compared to four machine learning
   methods: LASSO, decision tree (DT), regression vector machines (RVM),
   and kernel ridge regression (KRR). The obtained results show that ANN
   provides high effectiveness and accuracy for WP forecasting.
   Furthermore, ANN has proven to be an interesting tool in ensuring

   winds using machine-learning techniques},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Pages = {621-637},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {The increasing demand for wind energy offshore requires more
   hub-height-relevant wind information, while larger wind turbine sizes
   require measurements at greater heights. In situ measurements are harder
   to acquire at higher atmospheric levels; meanwhile the emergence of
   machine-learning applications has led to several studies demonstrating
   the improvement in accuracy for vertical wind extrapolation over
   conventional power-law and logarithmic-profile methods. Satellite wind
   retrievals supply multiple daily wind observations offshore, however
   only at 10 m height. The goal of this study is to develop and validate
   novel machine-learning methods using satellite wind observations and
   near-surface atmospheric measurements to extrapolate wind speeds to
   higher heights. A machine-learning model is trained on 12 years of
   collocated offshore wind measurements from a meteorological mast (FINO3)
   and space-borne wind observations from the Advanced Scatterometer
   (ASCAT). The model is extended vertically to predict the FINO3 vertical
   wind profile. Horizontally, it is validated against the NORwegian
   hindcast Archive (NORA3) mesoscale model reanalysis data. In both cases
   the model slightly over-predicts the wind speed with differences of 0.25
   and 0.40 m s(-1), respectively. An important feature in the
   model-training process is the air-sea temperature difference; thus
   satellite sea surface temperature observations were included in the
   horizontal extension of the model, resulting in 0.20 m s(-1) differences
   with NORA3. A limiting factor when training machine-learning models with
   satellite observations is the small finite number of daily samples at
   discrete times; this can skew the training process to
   higher-/lower-wind-speed predictions depending on the average wind speed
   at the satellite observational times. Nonetheless, results shown in this
   proof-of-concept study demonstrate the limited applicability of using
   machine-learning techniques to extrapolate long-term satellite wind
   observations when enough samples are available.},

Title = {Renewable energy sources integration via machine learning modelling: A
   systematic literature review},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB 29},
Abstract = {The use of renewable energy sources (RESs) at the distribution level has
   become increasingly appealing in terms of costs and technology,
   expecting a massive diffusion in the near future and placing several
   challenges to the power grid. Since RESs depend on stochastic energy
   sources -solar radiation, temperature and wind speed, among others- they
   introduce a high level of uncertainty to the grid, leading to power
   imbalance and deteriorating the network stability. In this scenario,
   managing and forecasting RES uncertainty is vital to successfully
   integrate them into the power grids. Traditionally, physical- and
   statistical-based models have been used to predict RES power outputs.
   Nevertheless, the former are computationally expensive since they rely
   on solving complex mathematical models of the atmospheric dynamics,
   whereas the latter usually consider linear models, preventing them from
   addressing challenging forecasting scenarios. In recent years, the
   advances in machine learning techniques, which can learn from historical
   data, allowing the analysis of large-scale datasets either under
   non-uniform characteristics or noisy data, have provided researchers
   with powerful data-driven tools that can outperform traditional methods.
   In this paper, a systematic literature review is conducted to identify
   the most widely used machine learning-based approaches to forecast RES
   power outputs. The results show that deep artificial neural networks,
   especially long-short term memory networks, which can accurately model
   the autoregressive nature of RES power output, and ensemble strategies,
   which allow successfully handling large amounts of highly fluctuating
   data, are the best suited ones. In addition, the most promising results
   of integrating the forecasted output into decision-making problems, such
   as unit commitment, to address economic, operational and managerial grid
   challenges are discussed, and solid directions for future research are
   provided.},

Pages = {128923-128931},
Abstract = {With the consuming of fossil fuels, sustainable alternative sources are
   needed for energy production. Renewable energy is an important source in
   the fight against climate change and provides economic benefits by
   increasing energy security. Solar energy is one of the popular renewable
   energy sources. The photovoltaic system is a technology that produces
   electrical energy from solar radiation. These systems, which are clean,
   renewable, and environmentally friendly, are important in terms of
   meeting our future energy needs. Photovoltaic system power forecasting
   is an important tool for both energy planning and energy management, as
   it increases the predictability of bulk power system. In addition, power
   estimates also allow improving the system efficiency and planning the
   maintenance date. In this study, due to its high accuracy, fast
   computation, and easy applicability, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
   method was used to estimate the daily average energy production of a
   solar power plant located in Elazig/Turkey. To improve the performance
   of the model, ELM's hyperparameters were optimized using the Modified
   Golden Sine Algorithm (GoldSA-II). To show the power generation change
   that occurs in parallel with the seasonal weather change, graphs of the
   real power of different months from the four seasons and the power
   estimated by ELM are presented in the study. The radiation, temperature,
   wind speed, real power, and ELM predicted power values for the ten-month
   period in which the operating data were obtained are given in the table.
   By examining this table, the effect of weather conditions on production
   can be observed more clearly. The R and RMSE values of the ELM model,
   which are calculated separately for each month, are presented in the
   form of a radar chart. The average daily R and RMSE values calculated
   for the ten-month period were calculated as 0.95 and 0.0716,
   respectively, and the performance of the ELM model used in the study was
   proven by the calculated R and RMSE values.},

Abstract = {Typhoon wind speed prediction is of great significance for it can help
   prevent wind farms from damages caused by frequent typhoon disasters in
   coastal areas. However, most researches on wind forecast are either for
   meteorological application or for normal weather. Therefore, this paper
   proposes a systematic method based on numerical wind field and extreme
   learning machine for typhoon wind speed prediction of wind farms. The
   proposed method mainly consists of three parts, IGA-YanMeng typhoon
   numerical simulation model, typhoon status prediction model, and wind
   speed simulation model based on an extreme learning machine. The
   IGA-YanMeng typhoon numerical simulation model can greatly enrich
   typhoon wind speed data according to historical typhoon parameters. The
   typhoon status prediction model can predict the status of typhoons
   studied in the next few hours. And wind speed simulation model simulates
   the average wind speed magnitude/direction at 10 m height of each
   turbine in the farm according to the predicted status. The end of this
   paper presents a case study on a wind farm located in Guangdong province
   that suffered from the super typhoon Mangkhut landed in 2018. The
   results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {The precise prediction of power estimates of wind-solar renewable energy
   sources becomes challenging due to their intermittent nature and
   difference in intensity between day and night. Machine-learning
   algorithms are non-linear mapping functions to approximate any given
   function from known input-output pairs and can be used for this purpose.
   This paper presents an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method to
   predict hybrid wind-solar resources and estimate power generation by
   correlating wind speed and solar radiation for real-time data. The
   proposed ANN allows optimization of the hybrid system's operation by
   efficient wind and solar energy production estimation for a given set of
   weather conditions. The proposed model uses temperature, humidity, air
   pressure, solar radiation, optimum angle, and target values of known
   wind speeds, solar radiation, and optimum angle. A normalization
   function to narrow the error distribution and an iterative method with
   the Levenberg-Marquardt training function is used to reduce error. The
   experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach
   against the existing wind, solar, or wind-solar estimation methods. It
   is envisaged that such an intelligent yet simplified method for

Abstract = {A probabilistic method for modelling empirical site-specific wind
   turbine power curves is proposed in this paper. The method is based on
   the Gaussian mixture model machine learning algorithm. Unlike standard
   wind turbine power curve models, it has a user-selectable number (N) and
   type of input features. The user can thus develop and test models with a
   combination of measured, derived or predicted input features relevant to
   wind turbine power-output performance. The proposed modelling approach
   is independent of the site location where the measurable input features
   (i.e. wind speed, wind direction, air density) are collected. However,
   the specific models are location and turbine dependent. AnN-featurewind
   turbine power curve model developed with the proposed method allows us
   to accurately estimate or forecast the power output of a wind turbine
   for site-specific field conditions. All model parameters are selected
   using ak-foldcross-validation method. In this study, five models with
   different numbers and types of input features are tested for two
   different wind farms located in Ireland. The power forecast accuracy of
   the proposed models is compared against each other and with two
   benchmarks, parametric wind turbine power curve models. The most
   accurate models for each of the sites are identified.},

Title = {Machine Learning Classification and Prediction of Wind Estimation Using
   Artificial Intelligence Techniques and Normal PDF},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Estimating wind energy at a specific wind site depends on how well the
   real wind data in that area can be represented using an appropriate
   distribution function. In fact, wind sites differ in the extent to which
   their wind data can be represented from one region to another, despite
   the widespread use of the Weibull function in representing the wind
   speed in various wind locations in the world. In this study, a new
   probability distribution model (normal PDF) was tested to implement wind
   speed at several wind locations in Jordan. The results show high
   compatibility between this model and the wind resources in Jordan.
   Therefore, this model was used to estimate the values of the wind energy
   and the extracted energy of wind turbines compared to those obtained by
   the Weibull PDF. Several artificial intelligence techniques were used
   (GA, BFOA, SA, and a neuro-fuzzy method) to estimate and predict the
   parameters of both the normal and Weibull PDFs that were reflected in
   conjunction with the actual observed data of wind probabilities.
   Afterward, the goodness of fit was decided with the aid of two
   performance indicators (RMSE and MAE). Surprisingly, in this study, the
   normal probability distribution function (PDF) outstripped the Weibull
   PDF, and interestingly, BFOA and SA were the most accurate methods. In
   the last stage, machine learning was used to classify and predict the
   error level between the actual probability and the estimated probability
   based on the trained and tested data of the PDF parameters. The proposed
   novel methodology aims to predict the most accurate parameters, as the
   subsequent energy calculation phases of wind depend on the proper
   selection of these parameters. Hence, 24 classifier algorithms were used
   in this study. The medium tree classifier shows the best performance

Title = {Profiling wind LiDAR measurements to quantify blockage for onshore wind
   turbines},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Flow modifications induced by wind turbine rotors on the incoming
   atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), such as blockage and speedups, can be
   important factors affecting the power performance and annual energy
   production (AEP) of a wind farm. Further, these rotor-induced effects on
   the incoming ABL can vary significantly with the characteristics of the
   incoming wind, such as wind shear, veer, and turbulence intensity, and
   turbine operative conditions. To better characterize the complex flow
   physics underpinning the interaction between turbine rotors and the ABL,
   a field campaign was performed by deploying profiling wind LiDARs both
   before and after the construction of an onshore wind turbine array.
   Considering that the magnitude of these rotor-induced flow modifications
   represents a small percentage of the incoming wind speed (approximate to
   3\%\$\$ \textbackslash{}approx 3\textbackslash{}\% \$\$), high accuracy
   needs to be achieved for the analysis of the experimental data and
   generation of flow predictions. Further, flow distortions induced by the
   site topography and effects of the local climatology need to be
   quantified and differentiated from those induced by wind turbine rotors.
   To this aim, a suite of statistical and machine learning models, such as
   k-means cluster analysis coupled with random forest predictions, are
   used to quantify and predict flow modifications for different wind and
   atmospheric conditions. The experimental results show that wind velocity
   reductions of up to 3\% can be observed at an upstream distance of 1.5
   rotor diameter from the leading wind turbine rotor, with more
   significant effects occurring for larger positive wind shear. For more
   complex wind conditions, such as negative shear and low-level jet, the
   rotor induction becomes highly complex entailing either velocity
   reductions (down to 9\%) below hub height and velocity increases (up to
   3\%) above hub height. The effects of the rotor induction on the
   incoming wind velocity field seem to be already roughly negligible at an
   upstream distance of three rotor diameters. The results from this field
   experiment will inform models to simulate wind-turbine and wind-farm
   operations with improved accuracy for flow predictions in the proximity
   of the rotor area, which will be instrumental for more accurate
   quantification of wind farm blockage and relative effects on AEP.},

Title = {A novel deep learning ensemble model with data denoising for short-term
   wind speed forecasting},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Wind speed forecasting plays a pivotal role in the security and economy
   of the power system operation. However, accurate prediction on the wind
   speed value is still quite challenging due to three features of wind
   speed: randomness, fluctuation and unpredictability. Though many
   previous works have studied decomposition-based methods for
   preprocessing, these methods are difficult to use in actual prediction,
   since the newly acquired data will greatly affect the values of the
   initial decomposed subsequences. To solve this problem, a good solution
   referred as the wavelet soft threshold denoising (WSTD) is proposed
   herein, which is also systematically introduced for the first time.
   Moreover, a novel deep learning method gated recurrent unit (GRU) is
   successfully developed to be combined with WSTD to forecast the wind
   speed series in this paper. In the ensemble WSTD-GRU model, the WSTD is
   applied to filter the redundant information from the original data of
   wind speed series; GRU, which is particularly advantageous for learning
   the features in case of cooperating with WSTD, is adopted to predict the
   future multi-step wind speed values. Also, the parameters of the GRU are
   adjusted by cross-validated grid-search, and they are visualized in the
   paper. In experiments, thirty-five commonly used models are involved for
   comparison to evaluate the forecasting performance of the proposed
   model, through the datasets from four sites in the United States
   covering a wide range of longitudes. Finally, a superior performance of
   this methodology with relatively high accuracy, fast forecasting speed,
   small volatility of results and good adaptability is verified by the
   test results of case studies aforementioned.},

Title = {Multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting based on multi-stage
   decomposition coupled with stacking-ensemble learning approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {143},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Wind energy is an emerging source of renewable energy in Brazil.
   Nevertheless, it already accounts for 17\% of the National
   Interconnected Network. Due to the great intricacy of wind speed
   variations, it is difficult to predict wind energy with high accuracy.
   This research offers, in these circumstances, an ensemble learning model
   based on variational mode decomposition and singular spectrum analysis
   in decomposition in multiple stages, using stacking-ensemble learning.
   The proposed model is tested and applied in short-term wind speed data
   from a wind farm located in Parazinho in the northeast region of Brazil,
   using a multi-step-ahead forecasting strategy. The selected models for
   forecasting were the machine learning models partial least squares
   regression, k-nearest neighbors, cubist regression, support vector
   regression, and ridge regression. The results of the study were divided
   into three comparative experiments: comparisons with (i) dual decomposed
   models, (ii) single decomposed models, and (iii) decomposed models.
   Concerning performance improvement, in the first experiment, the model
   was compared to dual decomposition models with an average performance
   between 3.71\% and 21.38\%. In the second experiment, mean performance
   improved between 37.18 and 52.47 percent compared to single
   decomposition. Lastly, the proposed model delivered, on average, 54.98\%
   better results than the models without decomposition. In summary, all
   compared models in all forecasting horizons were surpassed by the
   proposed model, with an average improvement between 3.69 and 56.61
   percent, showing that the dual decomposition ensemble learning model is
   an effective and accurate approach for forecasting wind speed.},

Abstract = {Wind speed forecasts can boost the quality of wind energy generation by
   increasing the efficiency and enhancing the economic viability of this
   variable renewable resource. This work proposes a hybrid model for wind
   energy capacity for electrical power generation at coastal sites by
   utilizing wind-related variables' characteristics. The datasets of three
   coastal locations of Kuwait validate the proposed method. The hybrid
   model is a merger of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Particle Swarm
   Optimization (PSO) and predicts one-month-ahead wind speed for wind
   power density calculation. The neural network starts its performance
   evaluation with a variable number of hidden-layer neurons to finally
   identify the optimal ANN topology. Comparisons of statistical indices
   with both expected and observed test results indicate that the ANN-PSO
   based hybrid model with the low root-mean-square-error and
   mean-square-error values outperforms ANN-based trivial models. The
   prediction model developed in this work is highly accurate with a Mean
   Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of approximately (3-6\%) for all the

Title = {Short-term wind speed forecasting using recurrent neural networks with
   error correction},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {217},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {As a type of clean energy, wind energy has been effectively used in
   power systems. However, due to the influence of the atmospheric boundary
   layer, wind speed exhibits strong nonlinearity and nonstationarity.
   Therefore, the accurate and stable prediction of wind speed is highly
   important for the security of the power grid. To improve the forecasting
   accuracy, a novel hybrid forecasting system is proposed in this paper
   that includes effective data decomposition techniques, recurrent neural
   network prediction algorithms and error decomposition correction
   methods. In this system, a novel decomposition approach is used to first
   decompose the original wind speed series into a set of subseries, then
   it predicts the wind speed by recurrent neural network, and finally, it
   decomposes the error to correct the previously predicted wind speed. The
   effectiveness of the proposed model is verified using data from four
   different wind farms in China. The results show that the proposed hybrid
   system is superior to other single models and traditional models and
   realizes highly accurate prediction of wind speed. The proposed system
   may be a useful tool for smart grid operation and management. (C) 2020

   Convolutional Neural Networks},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {121},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Wind power, as an economical and clean energy source, has rapidly
   infiltrated into modern power grids. Wind speed prediction is a pivotal
   technology for wind power integration, which has attracted much
   attention from researchers and practitioners. Nevertheless, traditional
   methods only focus on point prediction, which is far from meeting the
   requirements of power system risk assessment and risk control. To fill
   this gap, we propose an interval prediction and analysis system based on
   data preprocessing, deep learning, convolutional neural networks, and
   interval prediction. It can effectively predict and analyze the
   uncertainty in short-term wind speeds. First, an original wind speed
   sequence is divided into high-frequency and low-frequency data using a
   data preprocessing strategy. After deleting the high-frequency noise
   data, the denoised multidimensional time series is entered as input into
   an optimized convolutional neural network. Subsequently, the lower and
   upper bounds of the interval prediction are obtained using the interval
   construction principle and variance of the training data set. To verify
   the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid system, a 10 min wind speed
   data set of the Shandong wind farm in China is used as an example for
   analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid
   prediction system can not only effectively predict the variation trend
   of wind speed series, but also accurately predict the local
   characteristics and volatility of wind speed with strong randomness.},

Journal = {ACTA POLYTECHNICA HUNGARICA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Number = {9},
Pages = {45-56},
Abstract = {This study suggests employing a deep learning model trained on on-site
   wind speed measurements to enhance predictions for future wind speeds.
   The model uses a gated recurrent unit (GRU) derived from the long
   short-term memory (LSTM) variant, and is trained using actual measured
   wind velocity data collected at both 10-minute and hourly intervals. The
   approach relies on using same-season data for predicting wind velocity,
   necessitating regular updates to the model with recent measurements to
   ensure accurate predictions in a timely manner. The results from the
   prediction model, particularly at a 10-minute interval, demonstrate a
   significant alignment with the actual data during validation.
   Comparative analysis of the employed model over a two-year span, with a
   24-year distinction, indicates its efficiency across different time
   periods and seasonal conditions, contingent upon frequent updates with
   recent on-site wind velocity data. Given the reliance of sequential deep
   learning models on extensive data for enhanced accuracy, this study
   emphasizes the importance of employing high-performance computing (HPC).
   As a recommendation, the study proposes equipping the wind farm or wind
   farm cluster with an HPC machine powered by the wind farm itself,
   thereby transforming it into a sustainable green energy resource for the
   HPC application. The recommended approach in this work is enforcing the
   smart power grid to respond to the power demand that is connected to
   predictable wind farm production.},

Abstract = {Unsteady motion of the atmosphere incurs nonlinear and spatiotemporally
   coupled uncertainties in the wind power prediction (WPP) of multiple
   wind farms. This brings both opportunities and challenges to wind power
   probabilistic forecasting (WPPF) of a wind farm cluster or region,
   particularly when wind power is highly penetrated within the power
   system. This paper proposes an Improved Deep Mixture Density Network
   (IDMDN) for short-term WPPF of multiple wind farms and the entire
   region. In this respect, a deep multi-to-multi (m2m) mapping Neural
   Network model, which adopts the beta kernel as the mixture component to
   avoid the density leakage problem, is established to produce
   probabilistic forecasts in an end-to-end manner. A novel modified
   activation function and several general training procedures are then
   introduced to overcome the unstable behavior and NaN (Not a Number) loss
   issues of the beta kernel function. Verification of IDMDN is based on an
   open-source dataset collected from seven wind farms, and comparison
   results show that the proposed model improves the WPPF performance at
   both wind farm and regional levels. Furthermore, a laconic and accurate
   probabilistic expression of predicted power at each time step is
   produced by the proposed model.},

Abstract = {As grid-connected wind farms become more common in the modern power
   system, the question of how to maximize wind power generation while
   limiting downtime has been a common issue for researchers around the
   world. Due to the complexity of wind turbine systems and the difficulty
   to predict varying wind speeds, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine

   respect to the most recently published control techniques. To overcome
   the drawbacks of the existing literature, an in-depth overview of ML and
   AI in wind turbine systems is presented in this paper. This paper
   analyzes the following reviews: (i) why optimizing wind farm power
   generation is important; (ii) the challenges associated with designing
   an efficient control scheme for wind farms; (iii) a breakdown of the
   different types of AI and ML algorithms used in wind farm controllers

Abstract = {In this paper, a sparse machine learning technique is applied to predict
   the next-hour wind power. The hourly wind power prediction values within
   a few future hours can be obtained by meteorological/ physical methods,
   and such values are often broadcast and available for many wind
   generators. Our model takes into consideration those available forecast
   values, together with the real-time observations of the past hours, as
   well as the values in all the power generators in nearby locations. Such
   a model is consisted of features of high dimensions, and is solved by
   the sparse technique. We demonstrate our method using the realistic wind
   power data that belongs to the IEEE 118-bus test system named NREL118.
   The modeling result shows that our approach leads to better prediction
   accuracy comparing to several other competing methods, and our results
   improves from the broadcast values obtained by meteorological/physical
   methods. Apart from that, we apply a novel nonparametric density
   estimation approach to give the probabilistic band of prediction, which
   is demonstrated by the 25\% and 75\% confidence interval of the
   prediction. The coverage rate is compared with that yielded from
   quantile regression. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {In Machine Learning, the most common way to address a given problem is
   to optimize an error measure by training a single model to solve the
   desired task. However, sometimes it is possible to exploit latent
   information from other related tasks to improve the performance of the
   main one, resulting in a learning paradigm known as Multi-Task Learning
   (MTL). In this context, the high computational capacity of deep neural
   networks (DNN) can be combined with the improved generalization
   performance of MTL, by designing independent output layers for every
   task and including a shared representation for them. In this paper we
   exploit this theoretical framework on a problem related to Wind Power
   Ramps Events (WPREs) prediction in wind farms. Wind energy is one of the
   fastest growing industries in the world, with potential global spreading
   and deep penetration in developed and developing countries. One of the
   main issues with the majority of renewable energy resources is their
   intrinsic intermittency, which makes it difficult to increase the
   penetration of these technologies into the energetic mix. In this case,
   we focus on the specific problem of WPREs prediction, which deeply
   affect the wind speed and power prediction, and they are also related to
   different turbines damages. Specifically, we exploit the fact that WPREs
   are spatially-related events, in such a way that predicting the
   occurrence of WPREs in different wind farms can be taken as related
   tasks, even when the wind farms are far away from each other. We propose
   a DNN-MTL architecture, receiving inputs from all the wind farms at the
   same time to predict WPREs simultaneously in each of the farms
   locations. The architecture includes some shared layers to learn a
   common representation for the information from all the wind farms, and
   it also includes some specification layers, which refine the
   representation to match the specific characteristics of each location.
   Finally we modified the Adam optimization algorithm for dealing with
   imbalanced data, adding costs which are updated dynamically depending on
   the worst classified class. We compare the proposal against a baseline
   approach based on building three different independent models (one for
   each wind farm considered), and against a state-of-the-art reservoir
   computing approach. The DNN-MTL proposal achieves very good performance
   in WPREs prediction, obtaining a good balance for all the classes
   included in the problem (negative ramp, no ramp and positive ramp). (C)

Abstract = {The increasing concern about climate change and global warming led to
   the necessity to develop new energy sources. Within this scenario, wind
   power has become a major player due to its global availability and
   competitive prices. However, the intermittency and stochastic
   characteristics of the wind ultimately damper its efficient usage,
   increasing its operational costs. To mitigate this barrier, this work
   investigates the spatiotemporal phenomena underpinning wind speed and
   their usefulness when it comes to wind forecasting. We propose a new
   ensemble model based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) and GraphSAGE to
   predict wind speed in a bi-dimensional approach. The model was trained
   and validated using the Dutch dataset and considered several time
   horizons, timelags, and the impact of weather stations distributed
   across the country. To benchmark the results, the proposed model was
   compared against the persistence and LSTM models, as well as
   state-of-the-art paradigms such as LSSTM, GNN-GAT, and GNN-SAGE. The
   results showed that the ensemble SAGE-GAT was equivalent to or
   outperformed all benchmarking models and had lesser error values than
   those found in reference literature. The results also showed that the
   longer the horizon is to predict wind speed, the more relevant the
   spatial information passed from the stations is.},

Abstract = {The uncertainty and instability of wind power make it difficult to
   develop wind energy, wind farm grid connection, and power system
   stability, so accurate forecasting of wind power is very important. How
   to reduce wind power forecast errors and improve wind power forecast
   accuracy has become an urgent problem to be solved. The combined model
   proposed in this paper uses fast filtering algorithm (FCBF) and
   variational mode decomposition (VMD) to extract features of wind
   resource data, and uses least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) to
   predict short-term wind speed. Finally, according to the point
   prediction results and the prediction error, the wind speed range is
   estimated. In this paper, three groups of wind speed data at different
   times and regions are used for experiments. The experimental results
   show that the prediction error of the model designed in this paper is
   significantly less than that of the comparison model. The results show
   that the prediction system proposed in this paper is superior to all

Abstract = {The aim of this research was to forecast monthly wind energy based on

   The curve type fitting of five similar probability distribution
   functions (PDF, pdf), namely Weibull, Exponential, Rayleigh, Gamma, and

   with the temporal errors between target and measured values being
   extracted. The error pattern of wind speed was analyzed with different
   error estimation methods, such as average, moving average, trend, and
   trained prediction, for adjusting the intended following month's

   due to probable variations in the selected Lognormal distribution

Title = {Short-term offshore wind speed forecast by seasonal ARIMA-A comparison
   against GRU and LSTM},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {227},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Offshore wind power is one of the fastest-growing energy sources
   worldwide, which is environmentally friendly and economically
   competitive. Short-term time series wind speed forecasts are extremely
   sig-nificant for proper and efficient offshore wind energy evaluation
   and in turn, benefit wind farm owner, grid operators as well as end
   customers. In this study, a Seasonal Auto-Regression Integrated Moving
   Average (SARIMA) model is proposed to predict hourly-measured wind
   speeds in the coastal/offshore area of Scotland. The used datasets
   consist of three wind speed time series collected at different
   ele-vations from a coastal met mast, which was designed to serve for a
   demonstration offshore wind turbine. To verify SARIMA's performance, the
   developed predictive model was further compared with the newly developed
   deep-learning-based algorithms of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Regardless of the recent development of
   computational power has triggered more advanced machine learning
   algorithms, the proposed SARIMA model has shown its outperformance in
   the accu-racy of forecasting future lags of offshore wind speeds along
   with time series. The SARIMA model pro-vided the highest accuracy and
   robust healthiness among all the three tested predictive models based on
   corresponding datasets and assessed forecasting horizons.

Title = {A surrogate-model-based approach for estimating the first and
   second-order moments of offshore wind power},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {299},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Power curve, the functional relationship that governs the process of
   converting a set of weather variables experienced by a wind turbine into
   electric power, is widely used in the wind industry to estimate power
   output for planning and operational purposes. Existing methods for power
   curve estimation have three main limitations: (i) they mostly rely on
   wind speed as the sole input, thus ignoring the secondary, yet possibly
   significant effects of other environmental factors, (ii) they largely
   overlook the complex marine environment in which offshore turbines
   operate, potentially compromising their value in offshore wind energy
   applications, and (ii) they solely focus on the first-order properties
   of wind power, with little (or null) information about the variation
   around the mean behavior, which is important for ensuring reliable grid
   integration, asset health monitoring, and energy storage, among others.
   In light of that, this study investigates the impact of several wind-and
   wave-related factors on offshore wind power variability, with the
   ultimate goal of accurately predicting its first two moments. Our
   approach couples OpenFAST-a multi-physics wind turbine simulator-with
   Gaussian Process (GP) regression to reveal the underlying relationships
   governing offshore weather-to-power conversion. We first find that a
   multi-input power curve which captures the combined impact of wind
   speed, direction, and air density, can provide double-digit
   improvements, in terms of prediction accuracy, relative to univariate
   methods which rely on wind speed as the sole explanatory variable (e.g.
   the standard method of bins). Wave-related variables are found not
   important for predicting the average power output, but interestingly,
   appear to be extremely relevant in describing the fluctuation of the
   offshore power around its mean. Tested on real-world data collected at
   the New York/New Jersey bight, our proposed multi input models
   demonstrate a high explanatory power in predicting the first two moments
   of offshore wind generation, testifying their potential value to the
   offshore wind industry.},

Abstract = {Machine learning neural network (NN) algorithms are being applied for

   It is crucial for power grid dispatchability, stability, and

   employed in this study is an adaptive PNN with a probability density
   function and a decision-making function that adhere to Bayes' rule to
   achieve faster convergence and higher prediction accuracy. The obtained
   simulation results show that the recommended hybrid optimized PNN model

Abstract = {As wind power accounts for an increasing proportion of the electricity

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},

Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In predicting energy consumption, classic econometric and statistical
   models are used to forecast energy consumption. These models may have
   limitations in an increasingly fast-changing energy market, which
   requires big data analysis of energy consumption patterns and relevant
   variables using complex mathematical tools. In current literature, there
   are minimal comparison studies reviewing machine learning algorithms to
   predict energy consumption in Korea. To bridge this gap, this paper
   compared three different machine learning algorithms, namely the Random
   Forest (RF) model, XGBoost (XGB) model, and Long Short-Term Memory
   (LSTM) model. These algorithms were applied in Period 1 (prior to the
   onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) and Period 2 (after the onset of the
   COVID-19 pandemic). Period 1 was characterized by an upward trend in
   energy consumption, while Period 2 showed a reduction in energy
   consumption. LSTM performed best in its prediction power specifically in
   Period 1, and RF outperformed the other models in Period 2. Findings,
   therefore, suggested the applicability of machine learning to forecast
   energy consumption and also demonstrated that traditional econometric
   approaches may outperform machine learning when there is less unknown
   irregularity in the time series, but machine learning can work better
   with unexpected irregular time series data.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop uncertainty energy planning of net-zero

   large renewable energy generation in determining time-of-use power

   uncertainties of key weather parameters determining renewables
   generation with climate changes are quantified and various machine

   photovoltaic and wind power generation by 2050 with weather uncertainty.
   The study results indicate that the ambient temperature increases with
   time at the uncertainty range of {[}0, 17.82\%], the beam radiation ,
   sky diffuse radiation decrease with time at {[}-24.86\%, 0] , the ground
   reflected diffuse radiation and wind speed show an uncertain trend at

   generation in 2050 is projected to be 11.69\% and 0.61\% lower than
   those of the typical meteorological year. The peer trading cost saving
   in 2050 considering climate changes is reduced by 2.25\% and the annual
   equivalent carbon emissions are increased by 9.15\% compared with the

Title = {Short-term wind speed forecasting framework based on stacked denoising
   auto-encoders with rough ANN},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {38},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this paper, a multi-modal short-term wind speed prediction framework
   has been proposed based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Given the
   stochastic behavior and high uncertainty of wind speed, in modern power
   systems with high penetration of wind power, precise wind speed
   forecasting is necessary for the power utility managers. To ensure that
   the prediction results are sufficiently precise, in this study, a
   multi-modal method is designed based on denoising and prediction
   modules. In denoising module, at first, the optimal configuration of
   Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders (SDAEs) is determined based on Genetic
   Algorithm (GA), and, then, SDAEs are applied for pre-training the data
   to reduce the input data noise. Due to the fact that different data
   sources have different noise bases, the optimal structure of the
   denoising module is arranged completely independent of various input
   data. In the forecasting module, the Sinusoidal Rough-Neural Network
   (SR-NN) is utilized to predict wind speed. After that, denoising and
   forecasting modules are stacked together to make the holistic deep
   structure network. In this study, the Deep Learning (DL) approach has
   been utilized to extract more robust features from the input data in the
   denoising process. To handle the high intermittent behavior of wind
   speed, the rough neurons are considered. Rough neurons are made up of
   two pairs of conventional neurons that are known to be upper and lower
   bound neurons. Since the wind speed has a periodic and nonlinear
   behavior, an ANN, based on the sinusoidal activation function, is more
   accurate than the typical type of sigmoid activation function. In this
   paper, weather data from Ahar, Iran, which has a high potential wind
   power, is considered. In modern power systems, the extra short-term
   forecasting is also needed; therefore, in this study, wind speed
   forecasting in one hour and 10-minute intervals are employed. Input data
   are selected based on Grey Correlation Analysis (GCA), and according to
   the GCA result, in addition to wind speed data at various heights,
   environmental data such as humidity and temperature are also considered.
   To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, the simulation
   results are compared with other structures of ANNs and benchmarking
   machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
   Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) methods in different scenarios. In
   this comparison, the impact of DL has been thoroughly investigated. In
   this paper, the comparison of the performance of deep and shallow
   network structures has been studied.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Accurate forecasting of wind speed is crucial for power systems
   stability. Many machine learning models have been developed to forecast
   wind speed accurately. However, the accuracy of these models still needs
   more improvements to achieve more accurate results. In this paper, an
   optimized model is proposed for boosting the accuracy of the prediction
   accuracy of wind speed. The optimization is performed in terms of a new
   optimization algorithm based on dipper-throated optimization (DTO) and
   genetic algorithm (GA), which is referred to as (GADTO). The proposed
   optimization algorithm is used to optimize the bidrectional long
   short-term memory (BiLSTM) forecasting model parameters. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a benchmark dataset freely
   available on Kaggle is employed in the conducted experiments. The
   dataset is first preprocessed to be prepared for further processing. In
   addition, feature selection is applied to select the significant
   features in the dataset using the binary version of the proposed GADTO
   algorithm. The selected features are utilized to learn the optimization
   algorithm to select the best configuration of the BiLSTM forecasting
   model. The optimized BiLSTM is used to predict the future values of the
   wind speed, and the resulting predictions are analyzed using a set of
   evaluation criteria. Moreover, a statistical test is performed to study
   the statistical difference of the proposed approach compared to other
   approaches in terms of the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Wilcoxon
   signed-rank tests. The results of these tests confirmed the proposed
   approach's statistical difference and its robustness in forecasting the
   wind speed with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.00046,
   which outperforms the performance of the other recent methods.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Fluctuation in wind speed over the period of time can impact operation
   of a utility grid. Sudden large scale variation in turbine power, often
   termed as ramp event, can threaten the security of power system. In this
   work, we predict ramp events through a hybrid method based on discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) and learning algorithms such as Twin Support
   vector regression (TSVR), random forest regression (RFR), and
   Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for onshore, offshore and hilly
   sites. Wavelet transform-based signal processing helps extract features
   from wind speed. Results suggest that SVR based prediction models are
   the best in forecasting among the available models. Besides, CNN
   predicts ramp events closer to the TSVR model and gives a better
   prediction performance for larger training datasets. The proposed hybrid
   version of TSVR, RFR, and CNN models are compared with existing SVM,
   ANN, and ELM models and indicate significant improvement in predicting
   ramp events. Compared to SVM, TSVR and RFR are 17.88\% and 4.87\%
   efficient in terms of RMSE, respectively. Further, randomness in ramp
   event signal for all the wind farm sites considered is evaluated using
   log-energy entropy. Results reveal that compared to wavelet transform,
   empirical mode decomposition yields lower randomness in predicted ramp
   event signals.},

Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {292},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Efficient power generation and reduced operational cost are crucial to
   make wind energy a successful market player. To achieve satisfactory
   performance in wind turbine technology, it is essential to accurately
   predict the rotor equivalent wind speed (REWS). Since traditional wind
   transducers are difficult to measure multiple-point wind speed, related
   researches on predicting REWS are lacking. In this paper, a hybrid REWS
   prediction framework is proposed, which combines mechanism analysis and
   data-driven technique, aided by Lidar measurements. The framework
   employs the mechanism modeling and time delay analysis to achieve
   preliminary REWS prediction, but the accuracy is restricted by the
   quantity of Lidar measurement points. To enhance the prediction
   accuracy, a residual prediction model based on the data-driven technique
   is created to correct the mechanism prediction. Specifically, a novel
   combined modeling approach based on empirical mode decomposition and
   sample entropy algorithms is presented. Through reconstructing the input
   data of the combined model into high, middle, and low frequency
   components and exploring the prediction laws of different frequency
   components obtained by typical machine learning models, the combined
   residual prediction model is established. Additionally, an enhanced
   whale optimization algorithm named WOAmM is presented to optimize the
   parameters of the combined model. The proposed method is validated
   through a four-beam Lidar measurement scenario simulated by BLADED
   software. The experimental results indicate that the combined model
   outperforms each single model and the mechanism prediction, and improves
   the REWS prediction accuracy by up to75.04\%, 60.92\%, 51.85\%, and
   57.52\% in the four datasets, respectively. The proposed method could
   facilitate the utilization of Lidar in improving the performance of wind
   turbines.},

Abstract = {Accurate prediction of wind speed plays a very important role in the

   establish a hybrid wind speed prediction model based on Time Varying
   Filtering based Empirical Mode Decomposition (TVFEMD), Fuzzy Entropy
   (FE), Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), improved Chimp
   Optimization Algorithm (IChOA) and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit
   (BiGRU). Firstly, the original wind speed data was decomposed by TVFEMD
   to obtain modal components, and FE aggregation is used to decrease the
   computational complexity. Secondly, the components are processed by PACF
   to extract important input features. Thirdly, the BiGRU parameters are
   optimized using IChOA which is an improved version of ChOA. Finally, the
   optimized BiGRU is used to predict the decomposed components, and the
   predicted components are summed to obtain the final prediction result.
   In this experiment, the proposed model is used to predict the data of
   four months of a year from Station 46,060 of National Data Buoy Center,
   and the performance of eight benchmark models is analyzed. Experimental
   results show that TVFEMD and PACF can improve the prediction accuracy of

Abstract = {This paper proposes a multiple CNN architecture with multiple input
   features, combined with multiple LSTM, along with densely connected
   convolutional layers, for temporal wind nature analyses. The designed
   architecture is called Multiple features, Multiple Densely Connected
   Convolutional Neural Network with Multiple LSTM Architecture, i.e. MCLT.
   A total of 58 features in the input layers of the MCLT are designed
   using wind speed and direction values. These empirical features are
   based on percentage difference, standard deviation, correlation
   coefficient, eigenvalues, and entropy, for efficiently describing the
   wind trend. Two successive LSTM layers are used after four densely
   connected convolutional layers of the MCLT. Moreover, LSTM has memory
   units that utilise learnt features from the current as well as previous
   outputs of the neurons, thereby enhancing the learning of patterns in
   the temporal wind dataset. Densely connected convolutional layer helps
   to learn features of other convolutional layers as well. The MCLT is
   used to predict dominant speed and direction classes in the future for
   the wind datasets of Stuttgart and Netherlands. The maximum and minimum
   overall accuracies for dominant speed prediction are 99.1\% and 94.9\%,
   (for Stuttgart) and 99.9\% and 97.5\% (for Netherlands) and for dominant
   direction prediction are 99.9\% and 94.4\% (for Stuttgart) and 99.6\%
   and 96.4\% (for Netherlands), respectively, using MCLT with 58 features.
   The MCLT, therefore, with multiple features at different levels, i.e.
   the input layers, the convolutional layers, and LSTM layers, shows
   promising results for the prediction of dominant speed and direction.
   Thus, this work is useful for proper wind utilisation and improving
   environmental planning. These analyses would also help in performing
   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations using wind speed and
   direction measured at a nearby meteorological station, for devising a
   new set of appropriate inflow boundary conditions.},

Abstract = {As a promising renewable solution for sustainable power generation
   worldwide, wind energy is receiving continuing attention from both
   industry and the academic community. However, the randomness and
   intermittency of wind energy will affect the stable operation and
   stability of the power system and further affect the economic benefits
   of the power grid. What makes the matter worse is the inevitable
   coupling between each pair of wind turbines in the large-scale wind
   farm. Besides, the resolution of prediction is severely limited by the
   spatial scale of wind farms. These problems bring great difficulties for
   the control and scheduling of wind farms. To this end, this paper
   proposes a novel wind speed prediction method for wind farms by
   borrowing some wisdom from machine learning methods. First, density peak
   clustering (DPC) is employed to separate the tremendous number of
   scattered wind turbines into a much significantly reduced number of
   groups, the wind turbines in each of which are treated as a unity. Based
   on the priority setting of each indicator in clustering, the data are
   preprocessed with different weightings. Principal component analysis is
   utilized to avoid DPC's poor clustering effects in case the dataset is
   high-dimensional. Finally, by considering simultaneous effects from
   historical and present data, long short-term memory based deep learning
   neural networks are trained and used to iteratively predict the
   potential of the wind energy in each unit for each time slot. The
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by taking an
   in-service wind farm in China as an example.},

Abstract = {The growing integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid
   has introduced unprecedented uncertainty. Ensuring an appropriately
   scheduled reserve is essential to accommodate renewable energy's
   intermittent and volatile nature. This study introduces an innovative
   approach to ultra-short-term wind power forecasting, which relies on
   feature engineering and a hybrid model. The effectiveness of this
   proposed method is showcased through a case study involving a
   utility-scale wind farm in Inner Mongolia, China. The findings indicate
   that the hybrid model, which combines the XGBoost (Extreme Gradient
   Boosting) algorithm and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network with KDJ
   (Stochastic Oscillator), and MACD (Moving Average Convergence and
   Divergence), achieves the highest forecasting accuracy. Specifically,
   the proposed model yields a normalized mean absolute error of 0.0396 for
   wind power forecasting. The modelling and forecasting process takes
   approximately 550 s. Furthermore, the suggested method is employed to
   predict wind power and wind speed for a wind farm in the USA. The
   experimental results consistently indicate that the proposed model
   maintains a dependable performance across various raw datasets; it is
   suitable for use in power system operations.
   An increasing penetration of renewable energy has brought unprecedented
   uncertainty to today's grid, and properly scheduled reserve is a key to
   accommodate the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy. In
   this manuscript, the authors propose a new method for ultra-short-term
   wind power forecasting based on the long short-term memory network with
   XGBoost algorithm and combining future wind speed and wind power
   technical indicators. The authors develop a case study using wind power
   datasets from two different countries, and experiments show that the
   proposed method outperforms common machine learning and deep learning
   models in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, and

Abstract = {Wind power as a renewable source of energy has numerous economic,
   environmental, and social benefits. To enhance and control renewable
   wind power, it is vital to utilize models that predict wind speed with
   high accuracy. In the current study, for predicting wind speed at target
   stations in the north of Iran, the combination of a multi-layer
   perceptron model (MLP) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) was
   used to build new method (MLP-WOA) with a limited set of data
   (2004-2014). Then, the MLP-WOA model was utilized at each of the ten
   target stations, with the nine stations for training and tenth station
   for testing (namely: Astara, Bandar-E-Anzali, Rasht, Manjil, Jirandeh,
   Talesh, Kiyashahr, Lahijan, Masuleh, and Deylaman) to increase the
   accuracy of the subsequent hybrid model. The capability of the hybrid
   model in wind speed forecasting at each target station was compared with
   the MLP optimized by the Genetic Algorithm (MLP-GA) and standalone MLP
   without the WOA optimizer. To determine definite results, numerous
   statistical performances were utilized. For all ten target stations, the
   MLP-WOA model had precise outcomes than the MLP-GA and standalone MLP
   model. In other words, the hybrid MLP-WOA models, with acceptable
   performances, reduced the RMSE values from 0.570 similar to 2.995 to
   0523 similar to 2.751. Also, the obtained results indicated that the
   examined MLP-GA did not have a significant effect in increasing the
   estimation accuracy of standalone MLP models. It was concluded that the
   WOA optimization algorithm could improve the prediction accuracy of the
   MLP model and may be recommended for accurate wind speed prediction. (C)

Abstract = {Solar energy is a key renewable energy source; however, its intermittent
   nature and potential for use in distributed systems make power
   prediction an important aspect of grid integration. This research
   analyzed a variety of machine learning techniques to predict power
   output for horizontal solar panels using 14 months of data collected
   from 12 northern-hemisphere locations. We performed our data collection
   and analysis in the absence of irradiation data-an approach not commonly
   found in prior literature. Using latitude, month, hour, ambient
   temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and cloud ceiling as
   independent variables, a distributed random forest regression algorithm
   modeled the combined dataset with an R-2 value of 0.94. As a comparative
   measure, other machine learning algorithms resulted in R-2 values of
   0.50-0.94. Additionally, the data from each location was modeled
   separately with R-2 values ranging from 0.91 to 0.97, indicating a range
   of consistency across all sites. Using an input variable permutation
   approach with the random forest algorithm, we found that the three most
   important variables for power prediction were ambient temperature,
   humidity, and cloud ceiling. The analysis showed that machine learning
   potentially allowed for accurate power prediction while avoiding the
   challenges associated with modeled irradiation data.},

Title = {A novel genetic LSTM model for wind power forecast},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {223},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Variations of produced power in windmills may influence the appropriate
   integration in power-driven grids which may disrupt the balance between
   electricity demand and its production. Consequently, accurate prediction
   is extremely preferred for planning reliable and effective execution of
   power systems and to guarantee the continuous supply. For this purpose,
   a novel genetic long short term memory (GLSTM) framework comprising of
   long short term memory and genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to predict
   short-term wind power. In the proposed GLSTM model, the strength of LSTM
   is employed due to its capability of automatically learning features
   from sequential data, while the global optimization strategy of GA is
   exploited to optimize window size and number of neurons in LSTM layers.
   Prediction from GLSTM has been compared with actual power, predictions
   of support vector regressor, and with reported techniques in terms of
   standard performance indices. It can be evaluated from the comparison
   that GLSTM and its variants provide accurate, reliable, and robust
   predictions of wind power of seven wind farms in Europe. In terms of
   percentage improvement, GLSTM, on average, improves wind power
   predictions from 6\% to 30\% as opposed to existing techniques. Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test demonstrates that GLSTM is significantly different from
   standard LSTM. ? 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   short-term probabilistic wind power prediction},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {278},

Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Precise estimation of wind power is exceedingly challenging due to the
   quick and random fluctuations in wind speed. Therefore, this article
   presents a probabilistic intelligent method for wind power prediction to
   minimize the risk caused by the uncertainty of the generated power. The
   proposed method is realized through four important steps: 1. Analyzing
   the wind power time series signals; 2. Creating training patterns; 3.
   Training patterns by applying machine learning; 4. Making a
   probabilistic prediction based on the Monte-Carlo simulation. To
   estimate the wind power more accurately, the time series of historical
   data on wind power are decomposed into different levels by appropriate
   signal analysis tools, i.e., the wavelet transform and variational mode
   decomposition. Then, the intelligent tools, i.e., extreme learning
   machine and support vector regression, are used as predictor cores due
   to their high speed and accuracy. The obtained results show that the
   presented method can accurately predict the generated wind power in
   10-min intervals for the next hour. Moreover, the average value of the
   estimated data for 1000 repetition steps in probabilistic protection is
   very close to the real data. Thus, the proposed method can be
   effectively applied to both deterministic and probabilistic predictions.},

   Solar Power Forecast},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {667-688},
Abstract = {Global climatic changes and increased carbon footprints provided the
   main impetus for the decrease in the use of fossil fuels for electricity
   generation and transportation. Matured manufacturing technologies of
   solar PV panels and on-shore and off-shore windmills have brought down
   the cost of generation of electricity using solar energy on par with
   conventional fossil fuel. Initially, solar and wind power generation was
   envisioned for microgrids, serving small local communities. However,
   advancements in power electronics have now facilitated large solar and
   wind farms to be integrated with main power grids. In this context,
   hosting capacity, which is the amount of distributed energy resources a
   grid can accommodate, without significant infrastructure up-gradation,
   has gained importance. In determining the hosting capacity at a
   particular location, the uncertainties of wind and solar power
   generation play a role. Effective forecasting models using time-series
   weather data can be built to predict wind and solar power generation.
   This forecast is essential to ensure proper grid operation and control
   when renewable energy sources are already installed. The forecast is
   also useful in the planning stages for investment decisions and
   distribution system planning. While long-term forecasts are rarely
   needed for the operation of integrated grids, accurate short-term
   predictive models are necessary for scheduling. This paper presents an
   extensive review of various forecast models available in the literature.
   The study mainly focuses on the short-term forecast, providing a
   critical review of the duration of data used in each model and a
   synoptic comparison of their performance indices.},

Abstract = {Wind energy is a powerful yet freely available renewable energy. It is
   crucial to predict the wind speed (WS) accurately to make a precise
   prediction of wind power at wind power generating stations. Generally,
   the WS data is non-stationary and wavelets have the capacity to deal
   with such non-stationarity in datasets. While several machine learning
   models have been adopted for prediction of WS, the prediction capability
   of primal least square support vector regression (PLSTSVR) for the same
   has never been tested to the best of our knowledge. Therefore, in this
   work, wavelet kernel-based LSTSVR models are proposed for WS prediction,
   namely, Morlet wavelet kernel LSTSVR and Mexican hat wavelet kernel
   LSTSVR. Hourly WS data is gathered from four different stations, namely,
   Chennai, Madurai, Salem and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu, India. The
   proposed models' performance is assessed using root mean square, mean
   absolute, symmetric mean absolute percentage, mean absolute scaled error
   and R-2. The proposed models' results are compared to those of twin
   support vector regression (TSVR), PLSTSVR and large-margin distribution
   machine-based regression (LDMR). The performance of the proposed models
   is superior to other models based on the results of the performance

Abstract = {In the wind turbine wake control research, the analytical wake model
   does not consider the influence of direct control parameters on the wind
   turbine wake flow field, and its prediction accuracy is by no means
   satisfying. The numerical simulation method can accurately predict the
   wake effect, but its low computational efficiency renders it unable to
   be used in the iterative control optimization study. In this paper, a
   new wake model coupled with the direct control parameters (tip speed
   ratio and pitch angle) of a single wind turbine is built based on the
   machine learning algorithm for which the widely applied Artificial
   Neural Network (ANN) is applied for instance. By combining the ANN wake
   model with different wake superposition models, the best combinatorial
   model for quantitative evaluation of multiple wake interferences is
   achieved, which not only has great accuracy but also ensures high
   calculation efficiency. On top of the established combinatorial wake
   model, three in-line wind turbines are investigated for assessing the
   effectiveness of wake control optimization with respect to the
   traditional greedy control. The results show that by optimizing the
   control parameters (tip speed ratio and pitch angle) of wind turbines,
   the total power of the three wind turbine units is increased by 1.15
   similar to 3.48\% depending on the incoming wind speeds and distances
   apart between wind turbines. The power variation of each wind turbine
   shows that the increase in total power is achieved by the decreased
   power of the first wind turbine and the increased power of the second
   and third wind turbines. The research verifies the effectiveness of
   adopting optimized wind turbine wake control on the total wind farm
   power improvement numerically.},

Abstract = {To achieve a high penetration of renewable energy integration, an
   effective solution is to explore the interdependence between numerical

   power data are extracted by using the feature extraction technique, the
   predictor is designed based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and least

   the prediction models are optimized by improving cuckoo search (ICS) to
   obtain a reliable value, which is defined as the pre-combined prediction

   developed to allocate the weights of the pre combined prediction model
   to obtain the final predicted values. Four seasons dataset collected
   from regional wind farms in China is utilized as a benchmark experiment
   to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results of

Abstract = {Wind power is an indispensable part of clean energy, but due to its
   inherent instability, it is necessary to predict the power generation of
   wind turbines after a period of time accurately. Most recent approaches
   are based on machine learning methods, which map time series data to a
   high-dimensional space, follow Markov process in the time dimension, and
   extract time series features following the chronological order. However,
   due to the time-instability and highly spatially correlated nature of
   wind power data, the prediction methods which follow the chronological
   order cannot extract all features in wind power time series. This will
   lose the information contained in the sequence and lack spatially
   relevant information. This paper proposes a TSCN-LSTM model that
   includes a Time Series Cross-correlation Network (TSCN) and a long short
   term memory (LSTM) decoder to predict wind power generation after 30
   minutes. TSCN-LSTM not only collaboratively encodes the neighboring area
   and the neighboring time to fully tap the potential spatiotemporal
   correlation by TSCN, but also uses the LSTM decoder to enhance the
   timing relationship and to prevent the loss of timing information. At
   the same time, a data preprocessing method is proposed to enhance the
   spatial representation of the data. It makes that TSCN-LSTM can
   integrate the temporal and spatial feature extraction process to enhance
   the semantic expression of features. By establishing extensive
   interconnections between data in time dimension and space dimension,
   multiple types of cross-correlation information are generated which
   enables the model to distinguish different meteorological features and
   discover temporal and spatial correlations. A large number of
   experiments show that compared with the current leading SVR, LSTM,
   LSTM-EFG, GRU, Bi-LSTM and SATCN-LSTM methods, the wind power prediction
   mean square error is reduced by an average of 13.06\%, 12.44\%, 4.05\%,
   5.11\%, 6.94\% and 8.76\%, respectively.},

Abstract = {The challenges in applications of solar energy lies in its intermittency
   and dependency on meteorological parameters such as; solar radiation,
   ambient temperature, rainfall, wind-speed etc., and many other physical
   parameters like dust accumulation etc. Hence, it is important to
   estimate the amount of solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation for a
   specific geographical location. Machine learning (ML) models have gained
   importance and are widely used for prediction of solar power plant
   performance. In this paper, the impact of weather parameters on solar PV
   power generation is estimated by several Ensemble ML (EML) models like
   Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting for the first time. The
   perfor-mance of chosen ML algorithms is validated by field dataset of a
   10kWp solar PV power plant in Eastern India region. Furthermore, a
   complete test-bed framework has been designed for data mining as well as
   to select appropriate learning models. It also supports feature
   selection and reduction for data -set to reduce space and time
   complexity of the learning models. The results demonstrate greater
   predic-tion accuracy of around 96\% for Stacking and Voting EML models.
   The proposed work is a generalized one and can be very useful for
   predicting the performance of large-scale solar PV power plants also.

Abstract = {To face the impact of climate change in all dimensions of our society in
   the near future, the European Union (EU) has established an ambitious
   target. Until 2050, the share of renewable power shall increase up to
   75\% of all power injected into nowadays' power grids. While being clean
   and having become significantly cheaper, renewable energy sources (RES)
   still present an important disadvantage compared to conventional
   sources. They show strong fluctuations, which introduce significant
   uncertainties when predicting the global power outcome and confound the
   causes and mechanisms underlying the phenomena in the grid, such as
   blackouts, extreme events, and amplitude death. To properly understand
   the nature of these fluctuations and model them is one of the key
   challenges in future energy research worldwide. This review collects
   some of the most important and recent approaches to model and assess the
   behavior of power grids driven by renewable energy sources. The goal of
   this survey is to draw a map to facilitate the different stakeholders
   and power grid researchers to navigate through some of the most recent
   advances in this field. We present some of the main research questions
   underlying power grid functioning and monitoring, as well as the main

Title = {A novel ensemble model based on artificial intelligence and
   mixed-frequency techniques for wind speed forecasting},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {252},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Wind speed forecasting is of prime importance for wind power generation,
   which can bring tremendous economic, social and environmental benefits.
   However, previous wind speed forecasting studies mainly focused on
   proposing hybrid or ensemble models by combining different methods while
   ignoring the significant opportunities brought by the era of big data.
   In particular, the research and applications of mixed-frequency data
   modeling for wind speed forecasting are almost nonexistent, so some
   valuable issues remain and need to be studied in depth. In this context,
   a novel ensemble model, which successfully introduces mixed-frequency
   data into the field of wind speed forecasting and combines the merits of
   mixed-frequency models and artificial intelligence methods, is developed
   for wind speed forecasting. More specifically, the original wind speed
   data are preprocessed by an advanced data decomposition technique to
   effectively tackle the challenges caused by noise and capture the main
   characteristics that existed in the original data. Moreover, some
   artificial intelligence models and mixed-frequency models are designed
   as sub-models and employed to predict future wind speed changes; these
   models aim to make full use of the information existing in
   common-frequency and mixedfrequency data. Furthermore, a new ensemble
   forecasting model is developed by combining the power of kernel-based
   extreme learning machine and multi-objective optimization to ensemble
   the results output by the sub-models. Various experiments and
   discussions are designed using four seasons of data, and the proposed
   model achieves excellent forecasting results. For example, the mean
   absolute percentage errors of the proposed model are 4.4286\%, 6.6154\%,
   5.2740\% and 3.8682\% for wind speed forecasting during the four
   seasons, proving the superiority of the developed model and the
   innovations and contributions provided by this study from different
   perspectives.},

Abstract = {Wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing the operating
   efficiency of wind power systems for generating electric power.
   Currently, a substantial number of approaches have been developed to
   improve the precision of wind speed forecasting. However, owing to the
   instability and fluctuation of wind speed, many models ignore the
   deficiencies of the individual models and data preprocessing strategies,
   which leads to results with poor accuracy. In this study, a novel
   forecasting system that combines data denoising methods, traditional
   forecasting algorithms, and a combination optimization approach to
   predict wind speed is proposed. To analyze the training and testing
   dataset, this study uses the 10-min original wind speed dataset from a
   wind farm in Penglai, China. Based on the results of three comparative
   numerical simulations and the discussion of the pro-posed forecasting
   system, it is revealed that the developed model performs more
   effectively than other models. Therefore, in this study we conclude that
   the proposed combined forecasting system is an efficient and promising
   technique that provides precise results for predicting wind speed in the
   short term, and it could be employed for further applications in energy
   systems.},

Title = {Exploring the Effect of Meteorological Factors on Predicting Hourly
   Water Levels Based on CEEMDAN and LSTM},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The magnitude of tidal energy depends on changes in ocean water levels,
   and by accurately predicting water level changes, tidal power plants can
   be effectively helped to plan and optimize the timing of power
   generation to maximize energy harvesting efficiency. The time-dependent
   nature of water level changes results in water level data being of the
   time-series type and is essential for both short- and long-term
   forecasting. Real-time water level information is essential for studying
   tidal power, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
   (NOAA) has real-time water level information, making the NOAA data
   useful for such studies. In this paper, long short-term memory (LSTM)
   and its variants, stack long short-term memory (StackLSTM) and
   bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), are used to predict
   water levels at three sites and compared with classical machine learning
   algorithms, e.g., support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF),
   extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine
   (LightGBM). This study aims to investigate the effects of wind speed
   (WS), wind direction (WD), gusts (WG), air temperature (AT), and
   atmospheric pressure (Baro) on predicting hourly water levels (WL). The
   results show that the highest coefficient of determination (R2) was
   obtained at all meteorological factors when used as inputs, except at
   the La Jolla site. (Burlington station (R2) = 0.721, Kahului station
   (R2) = 0.852). In the final part of this article, the complete ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) algorithm was
   introduced into various models, and the results showed a significant
   improvement in predicting water levels at each site. Among them, the
   CEEMDAN-BiLSTM algorithm performed the best, with an average RMSE of
   0.0759 mh-1 for the prediction of three sites. This indicates that
   applying the CEEMDAN algorithm to deep learning has a more stable
   predictive performance for water level forecasting in different regions.},

Abstract = {Accurate ultra-short-term wind speed prediction is extremely important
   for the power control of wind farms, the safe dispatch of power systems,
   and the stable operation of power grids. At present, most wind farms
   mainly rely on supervisory control and data acquisition systems to
   obtain operation and maintenance data which includes operating
   characteristics of wind turbines. In the ultra-short-term wind speed
   prediction, a long short-term memory network is one of the commonly used
   deep learning methods. To address the problem that improper selection of
   long short-term memory network's hyperparameters may affect the
   prediction results, In the present study, a hybrid prediction model
   based on the long short-term memory and the modified tuna swarm
   optimization algorithm was established, and was used to predict after
   the wind speed sample data had been decomposed by successive variational
   mode decomposition method. The experimental results reveal that the
   proposed model effectively improved the accuracy of wind speed
   prediction for wind farms compared with the support vector regression,
   deep belief networks, and long short-term memory models optimized by
   particle swarm optimization algorithm.},

Title = {Machine learning based prediction of piezoelectric energy harvesting
   from wake galloping},
Journal = {MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {160},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Wake galloping is a phenomenon of aerodynamic instability and has vast
   potential in energy harvesting. This paper investigates the vibration
   response of wake galloping piezoelectric energy harvesters (WGPEHs) in
   different configurations. In the proposed system, a stationary obstacle
   is placed upstream, and a cuboid bluff body mounted on a cantilever beam
   with piezoelectric sheets attached to it, is placed downstream. Three
   different types of WGPEHs were tested with different cross-section S{*}
   of the upstream obstacles, namely square, triangular, and circular. At
   the same time, the tests were conducted by changing the equivalent
   diameter ratio eta = 1 similar to 2.5 of the upstream and downstream
   objects, the dimensionless distance between two objects' centers L{*} =
   L=D = 2 similar to 8, and the velocity span U{*} = 2.93 similar to
   14.54. The results reveal that S{*}, eta, L{*} and U{*} have significant
   effect on the vibration response of WGPEHs. Then, considering these four
   parameters as input features, this study has trained machine learning
   (ML) models to predict the root mean square values of the voltage
   (V-rms) and the maximum displacement (y(max)), respectively. The
   performance of three different ML algorithms including decision tree
   regressor (DTR), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting regression
   trees (GBRT) on predicting V-rms and y(max) were compared. Among them,
   the GBRT model performed optimally in predicting the V-rms and y(max).
   The GBRT model provides accurate predictions to V-rms and y(max) within
   the test range of S{*}, eta, L{*} and U{*}. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {653-663},
Abstract = {Efficient extraction of renewable energy from wind depends on the
   reliable estimation of wind characteristics and optimization of wind
   farm installation and operation conditions. There exists uncertainty in
   the prediction of wind energy tapping potential based on the variability
   in wind behavior. Thus the estimation of wind power density based on
   empirical models demand subsequent data processing to ensure accuracy
   and reliability in energy computations. Present study analyses the
   reliability of the ANN-based machine learning approach in predicting
   wind power density for five stations (Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai,
   Salem, and Tirunelveli) in the state of Tamil Nadu, India using five
   different non-linear models. The selected models such as Convolutional

   Network (RNN), Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network, and
   linear regression are employed for comparing the data for a period from
   Jan 1980 to May 2018. Based on the results, it was found that the

Title = {Gaussian process power curve models incorporating wind turbine
   operational variables},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {1658-1669},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The IEC standard 61400 - 12 - 1 recommends a reliable and repeatable
   methodology called `binning' for accurate computation of wind turbine
   power curves that recognise only the mean wind speed at hub height and
   the air density as relevant input parameters. However, several
   literature studies have suggested that power production from a wind
   turbine also depends significantly on several operational variables
   (such as rotor speed and blade pitch angle) and incorporating these
   could improve overall accuracy and fault detection capabilities. In this
   study, a Gaussian Process (GP), a machine learning, data-driven
   approach, based power curve models that incorporates these operational
   variables are proposed in order to analyse these variables impact on GP
   models accuracy as well as uncertainty. This study is significant as it
   find out key variable that can improve GP based condition monitoring
   activities (e.g., early failure detection) without additional complexity
   and computational costs and thus, helps in maintenance decision making
   process. Historical 10-minute average supervisory control and data
   acquisition (SCADA) datasets obtained from variable pitch regulated wind
   turbines, are used to train and validate the proposed research
   effectiveness
   The results suggest that incorporating operational variables can improve
   the GP model accuracy and reduce uncertainty significantly in predicting
   a power curve. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that the impact of
   rotor speed on improving GP model accuracy is significant as compared to
   the blade pitch angle. Performance error metrics and uncertainty
   calculations are successfully applied to confirm all these conclusions.

Abstract = {With the increasing integration of wind power systems into conventional
   power systems, an accurate wind speed (WS) forecasting technique is
   essential for the reliable and stable operation of the power grid. The
   availability of wind energy increases with the correct WS estimation
   technique. Linear statistical methods such as the Seasonal
   Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model have been
   popular in recent times for short-term and very short-term forecasting
   of WS. However, studies are continuing the effect of forecast errors
   resulting from different disaggregated time series on the resulting WS
   forecast error. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art machine
   learning model, the Prophet model, which has not been used in short-term
   wind forecasting before in the literature. The performance reliability
   and accuracy of the developed Prophet model's results were compared to
   those of the SARIMA model. The success of forecasting time-series data
   was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Square Error
   (RMSE) results. The models' reliability, accuracy, fit, and performance
   were evaluated using standardized residuals, autocorrelation function
   (ACF), and partial autocorrelation (PACF). The 7-day performance metrics
   of the Prophet model are 1.9, 2.5, 4.1, 3.8, 4.0, 8.4, and 2.1 for MAE,
   and 2.3, 2.9, 4.7, 5.0, 4.4, 8.6, and 2.5 for RMSE, respectively. The
   performance measures of the SARIMA model are 3.3, 4.1, 5.1, 4.8, 5.1,
   1.8, and 5.4 for the MAE, and 4.2, 5.1, 6.2, 6.2, 5.7, 2.6, and 6.2 for
   the RMSE, respectively. The Prophet model gave higher accuracy than
   SARIMA for all other days except 1 day (06.01.2018). As a result, the
   Prophet model outperformed the SARIMA model in predicting WS
   measurements 24 h ahead using quarterly training data.},

Title = {Pricing and hedging wind power prediction risk with binary option
   contracts},
Journal = {ENERGY ECONOMICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {126},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In markets with a high proportion of wind generation, high wind outputs
   tend to induce low market prices and, alternatively, high prices often
   occur under low wind output conditions. Wind producer revenues are
   affected adversely in both situations. Whilst it is not possible to
   directly hedge revenues, it is possible to hedge wind speed with weather
   insurance and market prices with forward derivatives. Thus combined
   hedges are offered to the wind producers through bilateral arrangements
   and as a consequence, the risk managers of wind assets need to be able
   to forecast fair prices for them. We formulate these hedges as binary
   option contracts on the combined uncertainties of wind speed and market
   price and provide a new analysis, based upon machine learning
   classification, to forecast fair prices for such hedges. The proposed
   forecasting model achieves a classification accuracy of 88 percent and
   could therefore aid the wind producers in their negotiations with the
   hedge providers. Furthermore, in a realistic example, we find that the
   predicted costs of such hedges are quite affordable and should therefore
   become more widely adopted by the insurers and wind generators.},

Title = {Short-term wind power combined prediction based on EWT-SMMKL methods},
Journal = {ARCHIVES OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {70},
Number = {4},
Pages = {801-817},
Abstract = {Since wind power generation has strong randomness and is difficult to
   predict, a class of combined prediction methods based on empirical
   wavelet transform (EWT) and soft margin multiple kernel learning (SMMKL)
   is proposed in this paper. As a new approach to build adaptive wavelets,
   the main idea is to extract the different modes of signals by designing
   an appropriate wavelet filter bank. The SMMKL method effectively avoids
   the disadvantage of the hard margin MKL method of selecting only a few
   base kernels and discarding other useful basis kernels when solving for
   the objective function. Firstly, the EWT method is used to decompose the
   time series data. Secondly, different SMMKL forecasting models are
   constructed for the sub-sequences formed by each mode component signal.
   The training processes of the forecasting model are respectively
   implemented by two different methods, i.e., the hinge loss soft margin
   MKL and the square hinge loss soft margin MKL. Simultaneously, the
   ultimate forecasting results can be obtained by the superposition of the
   corresponding forecasting model. In order to verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed method, it was applied to an actual wind speed data set
   from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for short-term wind
   power single-step or multi-step time series indirectly forecasting.
   Compared with a radial basic function (RBF) kernel-based support vector
   machine (SVM), using SimpleMKL under the same condition, the
   experimental results show that the proposed EWT-SMMKL methods based on
   two different algorithms have higher forecasting accuracy, and the
   combined models show effectiveness.},

Title = {Potentials and opportunities of solar PV and wind energy sources in
   Saudi Arabia: Land suitability, techno-socio-economic feasibility, and
   future variability},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Solar and wind energy sources hold significant potential to meet the
   escalating energy demand in Saudi Arabia sustainably. This research aims
   to assess the feasibility and prospects of deploying solar photovoltaic
   (PV) and wind energy systems in Saudi Arabia (SA). The study adopts a
   comprehensive approach, encompassing spatial analysis of land
   suitability, techno-socio-economic feasibility studies, and prediction
   of renewable energy (RE) resource variability and trends using machine
   learning techniques. Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial
   analysis is employed to identify suitable areas for establishing solar
   PV and wind farms based on multicriteria evaluation methods.
   Techno-socio-economic feasibility analysis of solar PV and wind energy
   systems, under various configurations and scenarios, is conducted using
   the System Advisor Model (SAM) tool. Furthermore, a Support Vector
   Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm is developed and deployed to
   forecast Global Horizontal Irradiation (GHI), wind speed, and
   influential weather parameters at different locations in SA. The
   projections of these variables derived from global climate models are
   utilized to analyze prospects and variabilities. The land suitability
   analysis identified four optimal locations for large-scale solar PV
   fields in Tabuk, Al Madinah, Makkah, and Riyadh provinces. Additionally,
   four promising wind farms were found in Al Madinah, Makkah, Riyadh, and
   Eastern provinces. The analysis also identified one location in Al Jouf
   province suitable for hybrid systems combining solar PV and wind energy.
   The techno-economic assessment revealed that wind farms performed best
   overall, achieving a capacity factor of 42.6 \% in Al Madinah province.
   Although current tariffs render projects economically unviable, solar
   PV, wind energy, and hybrid solar PV -wind technologies are economically
   feasible in SA at Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) rates above \$32.8/MWh,
   \$26.1/MWh, and \$50.6/MWh, respectively. The social development
   analysis estimated potential job creation from solar PV and wind energy
   deployment under different scenarios from 2020 to 2060, indicating that
   more ambitious climate targets could translate to millions of renewable
   energy jobs. The SVM model predicted solar irradiance with an R -squared
   value of 0.893. The CMIP6 model was then used to project the GHI for SA
   in 2049, suggesting an increase of approximately 19 \%. Wind speed is
   also expected to rise roughly 5 \% over the same period. The integration
   of GIS spatial analysis, techno-socio-economic modeling, and machine
   learning -based forecasting provides comprehensive insights into
   harnessing solar and wind energy in SA. This study facilitates evidence
   -based planning and risk assessment, crucial for a sustainable energy
   transition. The insights and roadmap derived from this research can
   inform policy frameworks, support the United Nations Sustainable
   Development Goals (UNSDGs), and attract private investments for RE
   development in SA. Consequently, this study establishes solar and wind
   energy as viable and promising solutions for meeting SA's growing energy
   demands sustainably, while minimizing the associated environmental
   impact.},

Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {189},
Pages = {188-198},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Effective short-term wind power prediction is crucial to the optimal
   dispatching, system stability, and operation cost control of a power
   system. In order to deal with the intermittent and fluctuating
   char-acteristics of the wind power time series signals, a hybrid
   forecasting model is proposed, based on Complementary Ensemble Empirical
   Mode Decomposition (CEEMD) and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)-Kernel
   Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), to predict short-term wind power.
   Firstly, the non-stationary wind power time series was decomposed into a
   series of relatively stationary components by CEEMD. Then, the
   components were used as the training set for the KELM prediction model,
   in which the initial values and thresholds were optimized by WOA.
   Finally, the predicted output values of each component were
   superimposed, to obtain the final prediction of the wind power values.
   The experi-mental results show that the proposed prediction method can
   reduce the complexity of the prediction with a small reconstruction
   error. Furthermore, performance is greater, in terms of prediction
   accuracy and stability, with lower computational costs than other

Title = {Investigating power loss in a wind turbine using real-time vibration
   signature},
Journal = {ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {159},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Wind energy is one of the fastest -growing sources of renewable energy;
   hence, a comprehensive understanding of all the environmental and
   mechanical factors that influence the power output from wind turbines is
   essential. Despite vibration being a crucial degradation indicator (and
   thus linked to wind turbine health), its role in influencing power loss
   is rarely explored. In this paper, we propose to use a novel feature,
   the vibration index, derived from the vibration data, to understand the
   power loss in wind turbines. The methodology adopted in this work
   involves modelling the gearbox health as the loss of generator speed
   using a data -driven methodology with vibration index as input. It was
   observed that vibration had a significant impact on the generator speed.
   Vibration of different parts of the turbine hub was found to lead to a
   loss of rotational speed in the generator, which in turn led to power
   loss. Wind turbine vibration was found to explain about 57\% (R2: 0.57)
   of the loss in speed. Further, the generator speed is linearly mapped to
   power with an accuracy of 85\% (R2:0.85), and consecutively, the
   predicted loss in the generator speed is mapped to the power loss in the
   turbine. The accuracy of power loss prediction was about 55\% (R2:
   0.55). The proposed methodology is applied to data obtained from a
   realworld onshore wind farm located in the state of Gujarat (India).
   This approach offers a datadriven and efficient methodology that
   augments the understanding of wind turbine operations and the complex
   relationship between vibration and the power output of a wind turbine.
   The outcomes of this research can contribute to improving wind turbine
   performance and enhancing decision -making for system maintenance and
   operation.},

Title = {Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Power Based on Sample Similarity
   Analysis},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {72730-72742},
Abstract = {Increasing the utilization rate of wind energy is of great significance
   to the improvement of energy structure, which is inseparable from the
   support of wind power forecasting (WPF) technology. However, it is well
   known that there is no certain WPF model suitable for all conditions,
   such as different regions or seasons. Therefore, instead of focusing on
   the combination of machine learning models in a specific scenario, this
   article proposes a two-stage modeling strategy of ``first classify and
   separately model, then perform pattern recognition{''} from the
   perspective of sample similarity analysis. That is, in offline mode, the
   historical database is divided into multiple categories with different
   characteristics, and prediction models are established for each category
   respectively; in online mode, pattern recognition is carried out on the
   prediction sample to select the corresponding prediction model. In this
   way, the WPF problem is decomposed into two strongly related tasks: wind
   power mode classification and wind power numerical prediction.
   Furthermore, the coupling and connection between mode classification
   task and numerical prediction task are strengthened through the transfer
   learning of sample features. Around the above ideas, specific methods of
   how to classify, identify, and predict are proposed, which are two-level
   clustering, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification model and
   Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) prediction models. Simulation results
   based on real-world datasets prove the effectiveness and superiority of
   the proposed hybrid model.},

Title = {A novel wavenets long short term memory paradigm for wind power
   prediction},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {269},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Wind power prediction is essentially important for smooth integration of
   wind power into the national grid pertained to its inherent
   fluctuations. To facilitate the wind energy production and balance
   production versus market demand, a precise, efficient and robust
   forecast model is required to encounter highly nonlinear and intricate
   nature of the problem. In this study, a machine learning paradigm is
   presented by exploiting the strength of recurrent neural networks based
   Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), embedded with wavelet kernels, to
   encompass the dynamic behavior of temporal data. The novel idea of
   wavenets utilizing LSTM (WN-LSTM) with Gaussian, Morelet, Ricker and
   Shannon activation kernels for power prediction from various wind farms
   make it a unique hybrid forecast model to enrich the ultimate
   utilization of deep learning for vanishing gradient and wavelet
   transformations for nonlinear mapping. The proposed methodology,
   WN-LSTM, is implemented on seven wind farms based in Europe for short
   term wind power prediction and is evaluated in terms of various standard
   performance metrics, such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute
   percentage error (MAPE). The results are compared with the
   well-established existing techniques and a percentage improvement of
   upto 30\% is observed on MAE. Multiple independent executions of the
   model are carried out to ensure its efficacy and robustness. Moreover,
   the interval prediction is complemented to quantitatively characterize
   the uncertainty as developing intervals, and the difference between
   means of predicted and actual power is 0.02 at 95\% confidence level as
   illustrated from ANOVA based Tukey's and Fisher's tests.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a hydrostatic tidal turbine (HTT) is designed and
   modeled, which uses more reliable hydrostatic transmission to replace
   existing fixed ratio gearbox transmission. The HTT dynamic model is
   derived by integrating governing equations of all the components of the
   hydraulic machine. A nonlinear observer is proposed to predict the
   turbine torque and tidal speeds in real time based on extreme learning
   machine (ELM). A sensorless double integral sliding mode controller is
   then designed for the HTT to achieve the maximum power extraction in the
   presence of large parametric uncertainties and nonlinearities. Simscape
   design experiments are conducted to verify the proposed design, model,
   and control system, which show that the proposed control system can
   efficiently achieve the maximum power extraction and has much better
   performance than conventional control. Unlike the existing works on ELM,
   the weights and biases in the ELM are updated online continuously.
   Furthermore, the overall stability of the controlled HTT system
   including the ELM is proved and the selection criteria for ELM learning
   rates are derived. The proposed sensorless control system has prominent
   advantages in robustness and accuracy, and is also easy to implement in
   practice.},

Title = {A Mechanical Sensorless MPPT Algorithm for a Wind Energy Conversion
   System based on a Modular Multilayer Perceptron and a
   Processor-in-the-Loop Approach},
Journal = {ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {186},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a novel mechanical-sensorless maximum power point
   tracking (MPPT) algorithm for a 400 W wind energy conversion systems
   (WECS). The algorithm is based on a permanent magnet synchronous
   generator (PMSG), which is connected to a rotor side power converter via
   a three-phase diode rectifier (3P-DR). In order to achieve a practical
   implementation and capture the maximum wind energy from a wide range of
   wind speed values by means of a cost-effective MPPT method, the novel
   MPPT algorithm is developed via the combination of an intelligent
   modular multilayer perceptron (MLP) approach and a simplified model of
   WECS. The rotational speed of the wind turbine (WT) is predicted by the
   modular MLP. This speed is used by the simplified model to compute the
   optimal current reference, which is used by a control interface for the
   rotor side power converter to track the maximum power point (MPP) of
   WECS. The modular MLP, which includes three feed-forward MLP structures,
   is designed by considering 266,001 data recorded from each conduction
   modes of the 3P-DR, namely: 2/0, 2/3, and 3/3 modes. Each MLP structure
   consists of two inputs, five neurons in the hidden layer and an output
   layer with one neuron, obtaining a considerable reduction in its
   computational complexity. The output voltage and current of the 3P-DR
   are the inputs to the modular MLP, while the rotational speed is the
   target to learn. Results based on the Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL)
   approach, clearly show that the efficiency of the MPPT process is
   99.95\% when WECS is subjected to random noise conditions and wind gusts
   at very high speed (in average above 7 m/s).},

Title = {Hybrid and Ensemble Methods of Two Days Ahead Forecasts of Electric
   Energy Production in a Small Wind Turbine},
Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The ability to forecast electricity generation for a small wind turbine
   is important both on a larger scale where there are many such turbines
   (because it creates problems for networks managed by distribution system
   operators) and for prosumers to allow current energy consumption
   planning. It is also important for owners of small energy systems in
   order to optimize the use of various energy sources and facilitate
   energy storage. The research presented here addresses an original,
   rarely predicted 48 h forecasting horizon for small wind turbines. This
   topic has been rather underrepresented in research, especially in
   comparison with forecasts for large wind farms. Wind speed forecasts
   with a 48 h horizon are also rarely used as input data. We have analyzed
   the available data to identify potentially useful explanatory variables
   for forecasting models. Eight sets with increasing data amounts were
   created to analyze the influence of the types and amounts of data on
   forecast quality. Hybrid, ensemble and single methods are used for
   predictions, including machine learning (ML) solutions like long
   short-term memory (LSTM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector
   regression (SVR) and K-nearest neighbours regression (KNNR). Original
   hybrid methods, developed for research of specific implementations and
   ensemble methods based on hybrid methods' decreased errors of energy
   generation forecasts for small wind turbines in comparison with single
   methods. The ``artificial neural network (ANN) type MLP as an integrator
   of ensemble based on hybrid methods{''} ensemble forecasting method
   incorporates an original combination of predictors. Predictions by this
   method have the lowest mean absolute error (MAE). In addition, this
   paper presents an original ensemble forecasting method, called
   ``averaging ensemble based on hybrid methods without extreme
   forecasts{''}. Predictions by this method have the lowest root mean
   square error (RMSE) error among all tested methods. LSTM, a deep neural
   network, is the best single method, MLP is the second best one, while
   SVR, KNNR and, especially, linear regression (LR) perform less well. We
   prove that lagged values of forecasted time series slightly increase the
   accuracy of predictions. The same applies to seasonal and daily
   variability markers. Our studies have also demonstrated that using the
   full set of available input data and the best proposed hybrid and
   ensemble methods yield the lowest error. The proposed hybrid and
   ensemble methods are also applicable to other short-time generation
   forecasting in renewable energy sources (RES), e.g., in photovoltaic
   (PV) systems or hydropower.},

Abstract = {Using distributed energy resources can fulfil an individual's energy
   requirement, reducing electricity bills and creating sustainable energy
   solutions. Earlier, customers needed help utilising energy resources due
   to their limited knowledge. Technological advancement helps to utilise
   distributed energy sources using machine learning, deep learning, the
   Internet of Things, Wireless technologies, big data, etc. Although there
   are a lot of provisions for utilisation, the central issue is
   forecasting the generated renewable energy without wasting the generated
   power. Data is generated based on long periods of energy generated from
   wind and solar irradiance. Then, the generated data is trained using
   deep learning models. The trained models can predict the generated power

   several smart homes and a microgrid is considered. This work proposes a

Abstract = {Ultrashort-term wind power forecasting with great precision and
   robustness is essential for improving power quality and reliability
   management and reducing the cost of rotating backup supply, thus
   guaranteeing the security and stability of power systems in large-scale
   grid-connected wind power. This study proposed a novel ultra-short-term
   wind power prediction model jointly driven by multiple algorithm
   optimization and adaptive selection. The original wind power sequence is
   decomposed into smooth subsequences by the optimized variational mode
   decomposition algorithm. Each sequence is predicted in advance by two
   outstanding prediction methods. The method with high accuracy is
   automatically selected for the prediction output of that sequence. The
   two excellent models are least square support vector machine optimized
   by improved whale optimization algorithm and hybrid kernel extreme
   learning machine optimized by sine cosine search-sparrow search
   algorithm, improving the prediction accuracy and efficiency. Based on
   three publicly available datasets, the proposed model has more than 41
   \% percent improvement in root mean square error compared to the current
   studies and about 20 \% percent improvement in root mean square error
   compared to the proposed models without selection strategy. Combined
   with the adaptive selection concept, the proposed prediction model can

Title = {A compound framework incorporating improved outlier detection and
   correction, VMD, weight-based stacked generalization with enhanced DESMA
   for multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting},
Journal = {APPLIED ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {348},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Precise wind speed forecasting contributes to wind power consumption and
   power grid schedule as well as promotes the implementation of global
   carbon neutrality policy. However, in existing research, the negative
   impact of outliers on forecasting models is ignored and the inherent
   shortcomings of the single predictors have not been taken seriously.
   Moreover, the intrinsic parameters of predictors are set by manual and
   empirical methods in some research, leading to difficulties in achieving
   optimal forecasting performance. To solve the shortcomings of existing
   research, a multi-step short-term wind speed forecasting framework is
   proposed by incorporating boxplot-medcouple (MC), variational mode
   decomposition (VMD), phase space reconstruction (PSR), weight-based
   stacked generalization with enhanced differential evolution slime mold
   algorithm (DESMA). Firstly, boxplot-MC is employed to achieve outlier
   detection and correction for preprocessing original wind speed data by
   analyzing values and trends. Then, the modified data is further
   adaptively decomposed into multiple subsequences by VMD, after which
   each subsequence is constructed into feature matrices through PSR.
   Subsequently, weight-based multi-model fusion strategy in layer-1 of
   stacked generalization is proposed to integrate the predicting values
   acquired by three primary learners, of which the weight coefficients are
   calculated with the error between actual values and predicting values.
   After that, kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) in layer-2 of stacked
   generalization is applied to predict the fusion result to obtain
   forecasting value corresponding to each subsequence. Meanwhile, an
   enhanced DESMA based on slime mold algorithm (SMA) and differential
   evolution (DE) is proposed to calibrate the parameters of KELM.
   Eventually, the final wind speed forecasting results are attained by
   summing the prediction values of all subsequences. Furthermore,
   comparative experiments from different aspects are undertaken on real
   datasets to ascertain the availability of the proposed framework. The
   experimental results are clarified as follows: (1) outlier detection and
   correction employing boxplot-MC is dedicated to analyzing values and
   trends effectively, with which the negative impact of outliers can be
   weakened while retaining valid data significantly; (2) VMD can
   prominently reduce the non-smoothness and volatility of wind speed data;
   (3) weight-based stacked generalization is conducive to exploiting the
   advantages of individual primary learners, contributing to compensating
   for instability; (4) DESMA enhances prediction accuracy by optimizing
   the parameters of KELM. Additionally, the code has been made available
   at https://github.com/

Title = {A spatio-temporal forecasting model using optimally weighted graph
   convolutional network and gated recurrent unit for wind speed of
   different sites distributed in an offshore wind farm},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {284},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Accurate wind speed forecasting plays an essential role in scheduling
   wind power generation. Currently, most existing models predict wind
   speed just based on temporal features and geographical information of
   wind turbine sites is usually neglected or not taken full use of,
   leading to poor prediction performance. To solve this issue, a novel
   spatio-temporal prediction model based on optimally weighted graph
   convolutional network (GCN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) is proposed.
   First, data preprocessing based on tensor decomposition is applied to
   recover missing speed values. Second, geographic and dynamic time
   warping (DTW) distance are both calculated to construct an optimally
   weighted graph for different turbine sites, which not only takes fully
   into account the geographic information but also the temporal similarity
   of speed series. Third, based on the weighted graph, GCN is used to
   extract spatial features from speed series adequately. Afterwards, by
   inputting spatial features of each site into GRU, respectively, the
   spatio-temporal features can be effectively extracted. Finally, model
   parameters are solved by iteration with a Huber loss. To demonstrate the
   proposed model, performance indexes including RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R2 and
   TIC are calculated. Results show that the proposed model has the
   smallest prediction error of all sites for multi-step short-term
   forecasting compared with prevalent models. Therefore, the proposed
   model effectively enhances prediction accuracy by making full use of
   spatio-temporal features.},

Abstract = {As the wind power dates have strong volatility and intermittency, it is
   difficult to meet the safety and stability of power system operation. To
   make full use of the characteristics of wind power data and further
   improve wind power forecasting performance, an innovative hybrid
   framework is proposed to response to the above challenges, of which the
   non-stationary weakening technique, sample entropy (SE)-based prediction
   model allocation, optimized reduced kernel extreme learning machine
   (RKELM) and a novel deep learning network are integrated befittingly.
   Initially, the original wind power sequence is decomposed into multiple
   sub-sequences by empirical wavelet transform (EWT) adaptively, after
   which SE is employed to analyse the high and low components of
   sub-sequences. Then, a simplified gate recurrent unit network (SGRU) to
   achieve the prediction of the component with low SE-value. Besides, for
   the components with high SE-values, the multiple parameters optimization
   is implemented for RKELM based on slime mould algorithm (SMA), which
   possesses superior convergence speed and precision. Ultimately, the
   final prediction results can be obtained by accumulating the predicted
   values of the multiple models. In the experiment phase, two datasets are
   adopted to verify the predictive ability of the proposed hybrid
   EWT-SMA-RKELM-SGRU model, where the sufficient results indicate that the
   proposed model has a superior performance.},

Title = {A novel asexual-reproduction evolutionary neural network for wind power
   prediction based on generative adversarial networks},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {247},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Accurate forecasts of wind power generation are essential for the
   operation of wind farms. But for the newly developed stations, it is
   difficult to make accurate prediction because there are no sufficient
   historical data available. It will thus be interesting to explore new
   data augmentation and prediction modeling approach adaptive to such
   new-built wind farms. In this regard, a novel asexual-reproduction
   evolutionary neural network (ARENN) for short-term wind power prediction
   based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient
   penalty (WGANGP) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is
   presented in this paper. To solve the dilemma that new-built wind farms
   lack sufficient wind power data, the WGANGP is first applied to generate
   realistic data with a similar distribution of real data to augment the
   training dataset, which is further decomposed into a series of more
   stable subsequences by the EEMD so as to reduce the prediction
   difficulty of the machine learning model. In this study, a novel ARENN
   prediction model is developed to make the short-term wind power
   prediction, in which an asexual-reproduction evolutionary approach is
   first proposed to optimize the neural network based on a set of
   different loss functions that facilitate the population of network
   parameters approximating to the global optimum along different error
   surfaces in the evolutionary process. The proposed approach is validated
   on the data collected from the wind farm located in Spain and the
   predicted results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed approach
   over other methods involved in this study.},

Title = {Ensemble Machine-Learning Models for Accurate Prediction of Solar
   Irradiation in Bangladesh},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Improved irradiance forecasting ensures precise solar power generation
   forecasts, resulting in smoother operation of the distribution grid.
   Empirical models are used to estimate irradiation using a wide range of
   data and specific national or regional parameters. In contrast,
   algorithms based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming
   increasingly popular and effective for estimating solar irradiance.
   Although there has been significant development in this area elsewhere,
   employing an AI model to investigate irradiance in Bangladesh is
   limited. This research forecasts solar radiation in Bangladesh using
   ensemble machine-learning models. The meteorological data collected from
   32 stations contain maximum temperature, minimum temperature, total
   rain, humidity, sunshine, wind speed, cloud coverage, and irradiance.
   Ensemble machine-learning algorithms including Adaboost regression
   (ABR), gradient-boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression
   (RFR), and bagging regression (BR) are developed to predict solar
   irradiance. With the default parameters, the GBR provides the best
   performance as it has the lowest standard deviation of errors. Then, the
   important hyperparameters of the GRB are tuned with the grid-search
   algorithms to further improve the prediction accuracy. On the testing
   dataset, the optimized GBR has the highest coefficient of determination
   (R-2) performance, with a value of 0.9995. The same approach also has
   the lowest root mean squared error (0.0007), mean absolute percentage
   error (0.0052), and mean squared logarithmic error (0.0001), implying
   superior performance. The absolute error of the prediction lies within a
   narrow range, indicating good performance. Overall, ensemble
   machine-learning models are an effective method for forecasting
   irradiance in Bangladesh. They can attain high accuracy and robustness
   and give significant information for the assessment of solar energy
   resources.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {222931-222943},
Abstract = {Accurate wind speed forecasting exerts a critical role in energy
   conversion and management of wind power. In term of this purpose, a
   hybrid model based on multi-stage principal component extraction, kernel
   extreme learning machine (KELM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) network
   is developed in this paper, where the multi-stage principal component
   extraction combines complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with
   adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and phase
   space reconstruction (PSR). Firstly, CEEMDAN is employed to decompose
   the raw wind speed data into a sequence of intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs) and a residual component. Then the principal components and
   residual components of all IMFs are captured by SSA. Meanwhile, all
   residual components obtained by CEEMDAN decomposition and SSA processing
   are added to form a new component. Subsequently, PSR is utilized to
   construct each forecasting component obtained by CEEMDAN-SSA into the
   input and output of training set and testing set for the prediction
   model. Later, KELM and GRU neural network are conducted to predict the
   high-frequency and low-frequency components, respectively. Eventually,
   the prediction values of each component are accumulated to acquire the
   final prediction result. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   model, four datasets from Sotavento Galicia wind farm are adopted to
   conduct experimental research. The experimental results manifest that
   the proposed model achieves higher accuracy of multi-step prediction
   than other comparative models.},

Title = {Sustainable urban energy solutions: Forecasting energy production for
   hybrid solar-wind systems},
Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {302},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, hybrid Solar-Wind energy system has emerged as a viable
   solution to achieve sustainable energy generation and alleviate the
   burden on the power grid. However, enhancing the system configuration to
   balance energy production and consumption remains a challenging task. In
   this study, we propose an energy forecasting methodology that leverages
   transformers as an AI tool to predict energy production from a hybrid
   PhotovoltaicWind system in an urban environment. The methodology
   involves pre-processing data, training the transformer model, and
   generating energy forecasts. The research utilized a one -year dataset,
   collecting data at 10 -minute intervals, encompassing various parameters
   like wind speed, wind direction, global horizontal irradiance, direct
   normal irradiance, and diffuse horizontal irradiance, all for the
   purpose of wind and solar energy prediction. The study additionally
   examined how the model's performance is impacted by fine-tuning
   hyperparameters and revealed that this dependency is inversely
   proportional to characteristics such as training data, horizon, and
   learning rate. Hyperparameters such as look back and epoch, on the other
   hand, were observed to have a direct link with the model's dependency.
   Multiple simulations have been conducted to fine -tune the
   hyperparameters of the machine learning model to improve its efficiency.
   The outcomes exhibited the energy forecasting methodology's
   effectiveness in predicting energy production for a hybrid
   Photovoltaic-Wind system in an urban environment. The forecasting
   accuracy for solar energy and wind speed reached impressive levels, with
   90.7\% and 90.4\% respectively, across various horizons. The time
   resolution used for forecasting was 10 min, and the data was split into
   training, testing, and validation sets with ratios of 60-20-20\% and
   70-15-15\%. Leveraging a transformer model for energy forecasting with
   an accuracy up to 90\% holds the promise of streamlining the planning
   and management of hybrid PV-Wind-Battery storage systems. This, in turn,
   can play a critical role in advancing the adoption of sustainable and
   efficient energy solutions for both residential and commercial
   structures. The code for timeseries data forecasting is available at

Abstract = {Integrated systems required for renewable energy use are under
   development. These systems impose more stringent control requirements.
   It is quite challenging to control a pumped storage system (PSS), which
   is a key component of such power systems. Because of the
   S-characteristic area of the PSS pump turbine, traditional
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control induces considerable
   speed oscillation under medium and low water heads. PSSs are difficult
   to model because of their nonlinear characteristics. Therefore, we
   propose a machine learning (ML)-based model predictive control (MPC)
   method. The ML algorithm is based on Koopman theory and experimental
   data that includes PSS state variables, and is used to establish linear
   relationships between the variables in high-dimensional space.
   Subsequently, a simple, accurate mathematical PSS model is obtained.
   This mathematical model is used via the MPC method to obtain the
   predicted control quantity value quickly and accurately. The feasibility
   and effectiveness of this method are simulated and tested under various
   operating conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed MPC
   method is feasible. The MPC method can reduce the speed oscillation
   amplitude and improve the system response speed more effectively than
   PID control.},

Abstract = {Wind energy in urban areas is a prominent alternative source of
   renewable energy that is becoming increasingly popular. The
   technological development, low cost of installation, and availability of
   wind make it a promising and essential renewable energy sector. Wind
   farms in urban settings, on the other hand, have yet to be
   commercialized in a meaningful way. In metropolitan areas, the urban
   wind becomes turbulent and unpredictable to some extent due to high-rise
   buildings and variations in their structures, railway tracks, and roads.
   Hence traditional wind mapping technologies have proven ineffec-tive in
   metropolitan areas, preventing its commercial use. This paper presents a
   thorough analysis of the most recent urban wind-resource evaluation
   techniques, covering multiple strategies, methodologies, software
   instruments, and the impact of site and building on the accurate
   installation of wind farms. Noise and vibrations, as well as aesthetic
   and shadow effects, ecological impact, high investment prices, and data
   availability, have all been considered, with potential solutions
   proposed. It has been found that in metropolitan settings, the
   traditional method of analyzing wind resources is hampered by the
   inability to collect data in a turbulent environment. As a result, this
   study predicts that artificial intelligence, such as machine learning,
   deep learning, and multiple neural networks, will dominate this industry
   in order to provide precise forecasts while minimizing the operational
   time and costs of the utilization system.},

Abstract = {Predicting the photovoltaic (PV) output power is essential for the power
   grid's secure, stable, and economical operation. Additionally, there are
   large numbers of meteorological variables that potentially affect the
   solar output of PV panels. Hence, identifying the most relevant
   parameters that influenced the PV output power is necessary for
   achieving accurate predictions and reducing the time-consuming and
   costly to acquire these parameters. With this main objective, four
   artificial intelligence techniques {[}Multilayer Feed-Forward Neural
   Network (MFFNN), Cascade Feed-forward Neural Network (CFNN), Radial
   Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), and Elman neural network (ENN)]
   were employed to identify the most influencing input parameters for
   prediction of the energy output of PV system. To develop the models, the
   mean daily average temperature, minimum and maximum temperatures,
   wet-bulb temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation, and
   wind speed were used as potential inputs to solar output prediction
   models. The data set covers 12 operating months (01 January-31 December
   2020). 57 models with various combinations of inputs were proposed and
   used to train the models to find the combination of inputs to determine
   the mean daily energy output of the PV system. The reliability of
   utilized models was examined by correlation coefficient (R), mean
   absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results
   indicate that MFFNN\#19, CFNN\#12, ENN\#24, and RBFNN\#32 with the
   combination of {[}Tmax, RH], {[}Ta, GSR], {[}Tw, GSR] and {[}D, Tmin],
   respectively, are the best models for solar output of the system.
   Moreover, a comparison of the performances of the artificial
   intelligence techniques with the quadratic model and multiple linear
   regression has been reported in this study. The results demonstrate that
   the ENN\#24 model with the combination of {[}Tw, GSR] generated superior
   results than the other models in terms of the R-squared, RMSE, and MAE,
   showing the ability of the model to estimate the PV output power.},

Abstract = {Solar and wind are now the fastest-growing power generation resources,
   being ecologically benign and economical. Solar and wind forecasts are
   significantly noteworthy for their accurate evaluation of renewable
   power generation and, eventually, their ability to provide profit to the
   power generation industry, power grid system and local customers. The
   present study has proposed a Prophet-model-based method to predict solar

   Australia. A SARIMA modelling approach is also implemented and compared
   with Prophet. The Prophet model produces comparatively less errors than
   SARIMA such as a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284 and a mean
   absolute error (MAE) of 0.394 for solar, as well as a MAE of 0.427 and a
   RMSE of 0.527 for wind. So, it can be concluded that the Prophet model
   is efficient in terms of its better prediction and better fitting in
   comparison to SARIMA. In addition, the present study depicts how the

Abstract = {This study focuses on predicting the output power of wind turbines (WTs)
   using the wind speed and WT operational characteristics. The main
   contribution of this work is a model identification method based on an
   adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) through multi-source data
   fusion on a moving window (MoW). The proposed ANFIS-MoW-based approach
   was applied to data in different time series windows, namely the very
   shortterm, short-term, medium-term and long-term time horizons. Data
   collected from a 30-MW wind farm on the west coast of Nouakchott
   (Mauritania) were used in the computational analysis. In comparison to
   nonparametric models from the literature and models employing artificial
   intelligence machine learning techniques, the proposed ANFIS-MoW model
   demonstrated superior predictions for the output power of the WT with
   the fusion of very few data collected from different WTs. Moreover, for
   various time series windows (TSW) and meteorological conditions,
   additional benchmarking demonstrated that the ANFIS-MoW-based method
   outperformed five existing ANFIS-based models, including grid partition
   (ANFIS-GP), subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC), fuzzy cmeans clustering
   (ANFIS-FCM), genetic algorithm (ANFIS-GA), and particle swarm

Abstract = {With the advancement of wind energy, solar energy, and other new energy
   industries, the demand for energy storage systems are worth increasing.
   Supercapacitors gradually stand out among many energy storage components
   due to their advantages of high power density, fast charging and
   discharging speed, and long life. Predicting the capacity of
   supercapacitors from historical data is a highly non-linear problem,
   subject to various external and environmental factors. In this work, we
   propose an optimized forecasting model-an extreme learning machine (ELM)
   model coupled with the heuristic Kalman filter (HKF) algorithm to
   forecast the capacity of supercapacitors. ELM is preferred over
   traditional neural networks mainly due to its fast computational speed,
   which allows efficient capacity forecasting in realtime. Our HKF-ELM
   model performed significantly better than other data-driven models
   models that are commonly used in forecasting life of supercapacitors.
   The performance of the proposed HKF-ELM model was also compared with
   traditional ELM, Kalman filtering model, ELM optimized by the particle
   swarm optimization (PSO-ELM) and Kalman filter extreme learning machine
   models (KA-ELM). Different performance metrics, i.e., Root Mean Squared
   Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE) and R2 determination coefficient
   were used for the comparison of the selected models. The aging life of
   supercapacitors in different environments were also performed using the
   proposed approach. The results revealed that the proposed approach is
   superior to traditional data-driven models in terms of prediction aging
   life of supercapacitors and it can be applied in real-time to predict
   state of health (SOH) based on the previous charge and discharge data of
   supercapacitors. In particular, considering RMSE of forecasting, the
   proposed HKF-ELM model performed 77.62\% better than the traditional ELM
   model, 77.46\% better than the PSO-ELM model, 87.40\% better than the
   traditional Kalman filter model, 82.51\% better than the KA-ELM model in
   forecasting aging life of supercapacitors. The novelty of the proposed
   approach lies in the way the fast computational speed of ELMs has been
   combined with the accuracy gained by tuning hyper parameters using HKF.
   Fewer setting parameters, lower time cost and higher prediction accuracy
   have been need in our methodology compared to available models. Our work
   presents an original way of performing aging life of supercapacitors
   forecasting in real-time in industry with highly accurate results which
   are much better than pre-existing life forecasting models. (c) 2022

   Characteristics under Future Climate Change Scenarios},
Journal = {COMPLEXITY},

Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {Assessment of climate change impacts on wind characteristics is crucial
   for the design, operation, and maintenance of coastal and offshore
   infrastructures. In the present study, the Model Output Statistics (MOS)
   method was used to downscale a Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   Phase 5 (CMIP5) with General Circulation Model (GCM) results for a case
   study in the North Atlantic Ocean, and a supervised machine learning
   method (M5' Decision Tree model) was developed for the first time to
   establish a statistical relationship between predicator and predicant.
   To do so, the GCM simulation results and altimeter remote sensing data
   were employed to examine the capabilities of the M5'DT model in
   predicting future wind speed and identifying spatiotemporal trends in
   wind characteristics. For this purpose, three classes of M5' models were
   developed to study the annual, seasonal, and monthly variations of wind
   characteristics. The developed decision tree (DT) models were employed
   to statistically downscale the Beijing Normal University Earth System
   Model (BNU-ESM) global climate model output. The M5' models are
   calibrated and successfully validated against theGCMsimulation results
   and altimeter remote sensing data. All the proposed models showed firm
   outputs in the training section. Predictions from the monthly model with
   a 70/30 training to test ratio demonstrated the best model performance.
   The monthly prediction model highlighted the decreasing trend in wind
   speed relative to the control period in 2030 to 2040 for the case study
   location and across all three future climate change scenarios tested
   within this study. This reduction in wind speed reduces wind energy by
   13\% to 19\%.},

Title = {Current status of hybrid structures in wind forecasting},
Journal = {ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {99},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wind power is one of the most important clean energy and alternative to
   fossil fuels. More attention has been paid to this renewable resource in
   today's world due to increasing public awareness, concerns about
   greenhouse gas emissions and environmental issues, and reducing the oil
   and gas reservoirs. Accurate and precise wind speed and wind power
   forecasts are the most critical and influential factors in making
   desired and efficient managerial and operational decisions in the wind
   energy area. Wind power and speed forecasting play an essential role in
   the planning, controlling, and monitoring of intelligent wind power
   systems. Therefore, several different models have been developed in the
   subject literature in order to predict this energy source more
   accurately. However, there is no general consensus on the model that
   must be selected and used in a specific situation of time horizon,
   sample size, complexity, uncertainty, etc. Hybrid models are the most
   frequently used and the most popular forecasting models in the energy
   literature. In this paper, combined approaches used in the wind energy
   forecasting field are first categorized into four main categories: 1)
   Data preprocessing based approaches, 2) Parameter optimization-based
   approaches, 3) Post processing based approaches, and 4) component
   combination-based approaches. Results indicate that the component
   combination-based category is the most diverse and extensive hybrid
   approach in the literature. Thus, in the next section of the paper, more
   attention is paid to these approaches and then classified into two major
   classes of series and parallel hybrid models. The literature review
   demonstrates that parallel hybrid models are more popular approaches in
   comparison with series hybrid models and more used for wind forecasting.
   Other specific and detailed conclusions and remarks are introduced in
   related sections.},

Abstract = {Accurate forecasts of ocean waves energy can not only reduce costs for
   investment, but it is also essential for the management and operation of
   electrical power. This paper presents an innovative approach based on
   long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the power generation of an
   economical wave energy converter named ``Searaser{''}. The data for
   analysis is provided by collecting the experimental data from another
   study and the exerted data from a numerical simulation of Searaser. The
   simulation is performed with Flow-3D software, which has high capability
   in analyzing fluid-solid interactions. The lack of relation between wind
   speed and output power in previous studies needs to be investigated in
   this field. Therefore, in this study, wind speed and output power are
   related with an LSTM method. Moreover, it can be inferred that the LSTM
   network is able to predict power in terms of height more accurately and
   faster than the numerical solution in a field of predicting. The network
   output figures show a great agreement, and the root mean square is 0.49
   in the mean value related to the accuracy of the LSTM method.
   Furthermore, the mathematical relation between the generated power and
   wave height was introduced by curve fitting of the power function to the
   result of the LSTM method.},

Title = {A multimodal approach to chaotic renewable energy prediction using
   meteorological and historical information},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {118},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wind energy, which exhibits non-stationarity, randomness, and
   intermittency, is inextricably linked to meteorological data. The wind
   power series can be broken down into several subsequences using data
   decomposition techniques to make forecasting simpler and more accurate.
   Because of this, a single prediction model does not perform well in
   extracting hidden information from each subsequence. To predict
   different frequency series, this paper employed shallow and deep
   learning models and proposed an improved hybrid wind power prediction
   model based on secondary decomposition, extreme learning machines (ELM),
   convolutional neural networks (CNN), and bidirectional long shortterm
   memory (BiLSTM). To begin, secondary decomposition was employed to break
   down the wind power series into several components. The ELM was used to
   forecast the low-frequency components. Following that, CNN was utilized
   to reintegrate the input characteristics of the high-frequency
   components, followed by BiLSTM prediction. Finally, the forecasting
   values for each component were added to generate the final prediction
   results. For one-, two-, and three-step predictions, the model was
   applied to the La Haute Borne wind farm. Additionally, four comparative
   experiments were conducted to validate the model's usefulness. The
   suggested model's mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage
   error (MAPE), and R-squared (R-2) values for one-step prediction of the
   March data were 14.87 kW, 22.24 kW, and 0.984, respectively, which
   indicate the proposed model's superiority to other prediction models.

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Solar irradiation (Rs) is the electromagnetic radiation energy emitted
   by the Sun. It plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth by
   providing light, heat, and energy. Furthermore, it serves as a key
   driver of Earth's climate and weather systems, influencing the
   distribution of heat across the planet, shaping global air and ocean
   currents, and determining weather patterns. Variations in Rs levels have
   significant implications for climate change and long-term climate
   trends. Moreover, Rs represents an abundant and renewable energy
   resource, offering a clean and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.
   By harnessing solar energy, we can actively reduce greenhouse gas
   emissions. However, the utilization of Rs comes with its own challenges
   that must be addressed. One problem is its variability, which makes it
   difficult to predict and plan for consistent solar energy generation.
   Its intermittent nature also poses difficulties in meeting continuous
   energy demand unless appropriate energy storage or backup systems are in
   place. Integrating large-scale solar energy systems into existing power
   grids can present technical challenges. Rs levels are influenced by
   various factors; understanding these factors is crucial for various
   applications, such as renewable energy planning, climate modeling, and
   environmental studies. Overcoming the associated challenges requires
   advancements in technology and innovative solutions. Measuring and
   harnessing Rs for various applications can be achieved using various
   devices; however, the expense and scarcity of measuring equipment pose
   challenges in accurately assessing and monitoring Rs levels. In order to
   address this, alternative methods have been developed with which to
   estimate Rs, including artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML)
   models, like neural networks, kernel algorithms, tree-based models, and
   ensemble methods. To demonstrate the impact of feature selection methods
   on Rs predictions, we propose a Multivariate Time Series (MVTS) model
   using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a decision tree (DT),
   Pearson correlation (Pr), logistic regression (LR), Gradient Boosting
   Models (GBM), and a random forest (RF). Our article introduces a novel
   framework that integrates various models and incorporates overlooked
   factors. This framework offers a more comprehensive understanding of
   Recursive Feature Elimination and its integrations with different models
   in multivariate solar radiation forecasting. Our research delves into
   unexplored aspects and challenges existing theories related to solar
   radiation forecasting. Our results show reliable predictions based on
   essential criteria. The feature ranking may vary depending on the model
   used, with the RF Regressor algorithm selecting features such as maximum
   temperature, minimum temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and
   relative humidity for specific months. The DT algorithm may yield a
   slightly different set of selected features. Despite the variations, all
   of the models exhibit impressive performance, with the LR model
   demonstrating outstanding performance with low RMSE (0.003) and the
   highest R2 score (0.002). The other models also show promising results,
   with RMSE scores ranging from 0.006 to 0.007 and a consistent R2 score
   of 0.999.},

Abstract = {The utilization of wind power is influenced by the fluctuation of the
   wind, to further strengthen the prediction accuracy of wind speed, two
   novel hybrid models uniting signal processing, deep learning and
   ensemble learning were proposed. Firstly, the wind speed series was
   disaggregated by the wavelet transform (WT). Then to enhance the
   forecasting precision of the subseries, the deep belief network (DBN)
   was applied to extract the high dimensional features. Besides, to
   overcome the limitation of the conventional DBN, the forecasts for each
   subseries processed by DBN were executed by the light gradient boosting
   machine (LGBM) and the random forest (RF). Some experiments have been
   accomplished, where the promotion of high dimensional feature extraction
   through DBN was explored. Meanwhile, the development of forecasting
   accuracy by applying tree-based models was confirmed, and the
   differences between these two hybrid models were discussed. It is shown
   that: (1) In comparison with the persistence method, the Elman neural
   network (ENN), DBN, LGBM, and RF, the hybrid models show a great boost
   in prediction accuracy. (2) The high dimensional feature extraction
   through DBN is in favor of improving the predicting accuracy of
   tree-based models, and tree-based models would facilitate the
   prediction. (3) Between the proposed models, the hybrid model integrated
   with RF slightly outperforms the other with LGBM in prediction accuracy,

   from an offshore wind farm using global attention mechanism},

Abstract = {Accurate ultra-short-term wind speed forecasting is great significance
   to ensure large scale integration of wind power into the power grid, but
   the randomness, instability, and non-linear nature of wind speed make it
   very difficult to be predicted accurately. To solve this problem,
   shifted window stationary attention transformer (SWSA transformer) is
   proposed based on a global attention mechanism for ultra-short-term
   forecasting of wind speed. SWSA transformer can sufficiently extract
   these complicated features of wind speed to improve the prediction
   accuracy of wind speed. First, positional embedding and temporal
   embedding are added at the bottom of the proposed method structure to
   mark wind speed series, which enables complicated global features of
   wind speed to be more effectively extracted by attention. Second, a
   shifted window is utilized to enhance the ability of attention to
   capture features from the edge sequences. Third, a stationary attention
   mechanism is applied to not only extract features of wind speed but also
   optimize the encoder-decoder network for smoothing wind speed sequences.
   Finally, the predicted values of wind speed are obtained using the
   calculation in the decoder network. To verify the proposed method, tests
   are performed utilizing data from an real offshore wind farm. The
   results show that the proposed method outperforms many popular models
   evaluated by many indexes including gated recurrent unit, Gaussian
   process regression, long-short term memory, shared weight long
   short-term memory network, and shared weight long short-term memory
   network -Gaussian process regression, in terms of mean absolute error,
   mean square error (MSE), root mean square error, mean absolute
   percentage error, mean square percentage error, and coefficient of

Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {A growing interest in renewable power increases its impact on the energy
   grid, posing significant challenges to reliability, stability, and
   planning. Weather-based prediction methods help relieve these issues.
   However, their real-world accuracy is limited by weather forecast
   errors. To help resolve this limitation, we introduce the SolarPredictor
   model. Publicly available weather forecasts are used to predict solar
   power production by a target photovoltaic power plant. To achieve high
   prediction accuracy, the model is trained on genuine weather forecasts,
   including errors and mispredictions. Further, we introduce the SolarDB
   dataset, comprising one year of power production data for 16 power
   plants. The dataset includes hourly weather forecasts with seven days of
   history, allowing our model to anticipate errors in the meteorological
   features. The prediction accuracy is evaluated on a wide range of
   weather forecast ages, accurately reflecting real-world performance. The
   SolarPredictor model is compared against 17 techniques, reaching an
   average RRMSE of 6.15 for 1-day, 8.54 for 3-day, and 8.89 for 7-day
   predictions on the SolarDB dataset. Finally, we analyze the effects of
   weather forecast uncertainty on prediction accuracy, showing there is at
   least a 23\% performance gap compared to using zero-error weather. Data

   very short-term solar irradiation to compute photovoltaic generators'
   output power},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {229},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Photovoltaic generation has arisen as a solution for the present energy
   challenge. However, power obtained through solar technologies has a
   strong correlation with certain meteorological variables such as solar
   irradiation, wind speed or ambient temperature. As a consequence, small
   changes in these variables can produce unexpected deviations in energy
   production. Although many research articles have been published in the
   last few years proposing different models for predicting these
   parameters, the vast majority of them do not consider spatiotemporal
   parameters. Hence, this paper presents a new solar irradiation
   forecaster which combines the advantages of machine learning and the
   optimisation of both spatial and temporal parameters in order to predict
   solar irradiation 10 min ahead. A validation step demonstrated that the
   deviation between the actual and forecasted solar irradiation was lower
   than 4\% in 82.95\% of the examined days. With regard to the error
   metrics, the root mean square error was 50.80 W/m(2), an improvement of
   11.27\% compared with the persistence model, which was used as a
   benchmark. The results indicate that the developed forecaster can be
   integrated into photovoltaic generators' to predict their output power,
   thus promoting their inclusion in the main power network. (C) 2021

   Decision tree outperformed all other methods with an accuracy of
   0.99321. The second work of this article explored the forecasting of the
   possible powers predicted with the LSTM deep learning method by the
   generation of the Solar PV array and wind turbines which were simulated
   on PVLib and Windpowerlib. The results are favorable, and the LSTM has
   performed well on the different hyperparameters. With the combination of
   machine learning and deep learning, it was possible to theoretically
   conclude the integration of renewable energies since we investigated all
   the potential possibilities in evaluating meteorological parameters and
   power predictions. Finally, decision scores from the Decision Tree
   architecture and the LSTM features were integrated to form a hybrid
   Tree-LSTM fusion method. It introduces a novel architectural concept
   that can effectively address sequential data and harness the non-linear
   capabilities of decision trees. The proposed model was validated by
   tuning the hyperparameters. Enhancing the maximum depth of the model
   increases the performance at a certain point, and conversely, reducing
   the minimum sample split improves the model performance. These
   contributions will help to create sustainable energy systems and
   increase the transition to a clean CO2 environment.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a proactive operation scheme for improving
   distribution system resiliency against natural hazards, specifically
   windstorms. In this context, important attributes associated with the
   windstorm consisting the distance from the windstorm route, the wind
   speed, the distance from tall trees and buildings, and cable type are
   used in a deep neural network (DNN) engine to identify the vulnerable
   branches and predict their failure during the windstorm. The DNN
   predictive model is integrated in the proposed scheme. Afterwards, a
   power flow-based optimization engine is employed to proactively enhance
   the grid resiliency. Grid resiliency is measured by the inevitable
   action of load shedding. For minimum load shedding, the optimization
   engine reconfigures the network topology, optimizes the droop parameter
   settings, and allocates mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) before the
   arrival of the windstorm. This optimization engine is integrated in the
   proposed scheme. To validate its performance, the proposed proactive
   scheme is tested on a 33-bus test system with a mix of diesel units
   (DUs), wind turbines (WTs), and photovoltaic units (PVs). The simulation
   results demonstrate that without the proposed learning mechanism, the
   load shedding can reach up to 36\% for the system under study, while the
   learning-based scheme can reduce the load shedding to 13\%. The proposed
   learning-based proactive operation scheme would substantially improve
   the distribution system resiliency during windstorms.},

Abstract = {Country-wide, hourly-averaged solar plus wind power generation (MW) data
   (8784 data records) published for Germany in 2016 is compiled to include
   ten influential variables related weather, ground-surface environmental
   and a specifically calculated day-head electricity price index. The
   transparent open box (TOB) learning network, a recently developed
   optimized nearest neighbour, data matching, prediction algorithm,
   accurately predicts MW and facilitates data mining for this historical
   dataset. The TOB analysis results in MW prediction outliers for about
   1.5\% of the data records. These outliers are revealed via TOB analysis
   to be related to uncommon conditions occurring on a few specific days
   typical over hourly sequences involving rapid change in weather-related
   conditions. Such outliers are readily identified and explained
   individually by the TOB algorithm's data mining capabilities. A slightly
   filtered dataset (excluding 129 identified outliers) improves TOB's
   prediction accuracy. The TOB algorithm facilitates accurate predictions
   and detailed evaluation over a range of historical temporal scales on a
   country-wide basis that could also be applied to regional spatial
   predictions. These attributes of the TOB method are conducive with it
   eventually being incorporated into forward-looking renewable forecasting

Abstract = {Wind energy has become one of the most efficient renewable energy
   sources. However, the wind has the characteristics of intermittence and
   uncontrollability, so it is challenging to predict wind speed
   accurately. Considering the shortcomings of traditional wind power point
   predictions, a new hybrid model comprised three main modules used for
   data preprocessing, deterministic point prediction, and interval
   prediction is proposed to predict the wind speed interval. The first
   module, the data preprocessing module, uses variational mode
   decomposition (VMD), sample entropy (SE), and singular spectrum analysis
   (SSA) to extract the different frequency components of the initial wind
   speed series. The second module, the deterministic point prediction
   module, uses extreme learning machines (ELM), and a gated recursive unit
   (GRU) model to perform point prediction on the wind speed series. The
   third module, the interval prediction module, uses the nonparametric
   kernel density estimation method to construct the upper and lower bounds
   of the wind speed interval. In addition, the final wind speed prediction
   interval is obtained by integrating the prediction results of multiple
   interval prediction results to improve the robustness and generalization
   of the wind speed interval prediction. Finally, the effectiveness of the
   prediction performance of the proposed hybrid model is verified based on
   the data of two actual wind farms. The experimental results show that
   the proposed hybrid model can obtain the appropriate wind speed interval
   with high confidence and quality with different confidence levels of
   95\%, 90\%, and 85\%.},

Title = {Optimal Day-Ahead Self-Scheduling and Operation of Prosumer Microgrids
   Using Hybrid Machine Learning-Based Weather and Load Forecasting},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {157284-157305},
Abstract = {Prosumer microgrids (PMGs) are considered as active users in smart
   grids. These units are able to generate and sell electricity to
   aggregators or neighbor consumers in the prosumer market. Although the
   optimal scheduling and operation of PMGs have received a great deal of
   attention in recent studies, the challenges of PMG's uncertainties such
   as stochastic behavior of load data and weather conditions (solar
   irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed) and corresponding
   solutions have not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, a new
   energy management systems (EMS) based on weather and load forecasting is
   proposed for PMG's optimal scheduling and operation. Developing a novel
   hybrid machine learning-based method using adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural
   network (ANN), and radial basis function (RBF) ANN to precisely predict
   the load and weather data is one of the most important contributions of
   this article. The performance of the forecasting process is improved by
   using a hybrid machine learning-based forecasting method instead of
   conventional ones. The demand response (DR) program based on the
   forecasted data and considering the degradation cost of the battery
   storage system (BSS) are other contributions. The comparison of obtained
   test results with those of other existing approaches illustrates that
   more appropriate PMG's operation cost is achievable by applying the
   proposed DR-based EMS using a new hybrid machine learning forecasting
   method.},

Title = {A hybrid framework for forecasting power generation of multiple
   renewable energy sources},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {172},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The accurate power generation forecast of multiple renewable energy
   sources is significant for the power scheduling of renewable energy
   systems. However, previous studies focused more on the prediction of a
   single energy source, ignoring the relationship among different energy
   sources, and failing to predict accurate power generation for all energy
   sources simultaneously. This paper proposes a hybrid framework for the
   power gen-eration forecast of multiple renewable energy sources to
   overcome deficiencies. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is developed
   to extract the local correlations among multiple energy sources, the
   Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (A-LSTM) network is developed to
   capture the nonlinear time-series characteristics of weather conditions
   and individual energy, and the Auto-Regression model is applied to
   extract the linear time -series characteristics of each energy source.
   The accuracy and practicality of the proposed method are verified by
   taking a renewable energy system as an example. The results show that
   the hybrid framework is more accurate than other advanced models, such
   as artificial neural networks and decision trees. Mean absolute errors
   of the proposed method are reduced by 13.4\%, 22.9\%, and 27.1\% for
   solar PV, solar thermal, and wind power compared with A-LSTM. The
   sensitivity analysis has been conducted to test the effectiveness of
   each component of the proposed hybrid framework to prove the
   significance of energy correlation patterns with higher accuracy and
   stability compared with the other two patterns.},

   forecasting},

Abstract = {Accurate wind speed prediction plays a vital role in power system in
   terms of rational dispatching and safe operation. For this purpose, a
   novel composite framework integrating time varying filter-based
   empirical mode decomposition (TVF-EMD), fuzzy entropy (FE) theory,
   singular spectrum analysis (SSA), phase space reconstruction (PSR),
   compound prediction models adopting kernel-based extreme learning
   machine (KELM) and convolutional long short-term memory network
   (ConvLSTM) as well as mutation and hierarchy-based hybrid optimization
   algorithm, is proposed in this paper. Among the supplementary
   strategies, TVF-EMD, FE and SSA are employed to achieve non-stationary
   raw series attenuation, aggregation for approximate IMFs as well as
   separation of dominant and residuary ingredients from the aggregated
   IMFs, respectively. Besides, parameters of PSR and KELM as well as
   wrapper method-based feature selection (FS) for input combination are
   synchronously optimized by the newly developed swarm optimizer
   integrating Harris hawks optimization (HHO) and grey wolf optimizer
   (GWO) with mutation operator and hierarchy strategy. Meanwhile, such
   hybrid structure is adopted to predict the preprocessed high-frequency
   components, while the remaining component is predicted by ConvLSTM
   cells-based deep learning network. Subsequently, the ultimate
   forecasting results of the raw wind speed are calculated by
   superimposing the predicted values of all components. Four datasets
   collected from various sites with two different time intervals and nine
   relevant contrastive models are carried out to evaluate the proposed
   approach, where the corresponding results demonstrate that: (1) data
   preprocessing strategy applying TVF-EMD and FE theory can significantly
   reduce the time consumption of the entire model without decreasing
   forecasting performance; (2) SSA-based dominant ingredients extraction
   can further improve the forecasting capability of combined model; (3)
   the proposed MHHOGWO can synchronously accomplish parameters
   optimization and FS effectively, thus improving the forecasting
   effectiveness of the entire model significantly; (4) the proposed
   compound prediction models based on KELM and ConvLSTM can exert the
   capabilities of each model adequately as well as ulteriorly reducing
   computational requirements.},

Abstract = {Thermal energy harvesting has seen a rise in popularity in recent years
   due to its potential to generate renewable energy from the sun. One of
   the key components of this process is the solar absorber, which is
   responsible for converting solar radiation into thermal energy. In this
   paper, a smart performance optimization of energy efficient solar
   absorber for thermal energy harvesting is proposed for modern industrial
   environments using solar deep learning model. In this model, data is
   collected from multiple sensors over time that measure various
   environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,
   atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation. This data is then used to
   train a machine learning algorithm to make predictions on how much
   thermal energy can be harvested from a particular panel or system. In a
   computational range, the proposed solar deep learning model (SDLM)
   reached 83.22 \% of testing and 91.72 \% of training results of false
   positive absorption rate, 69.88 \% of testing and 81.48 \% of training
   results of false absorption discovery rate, 81.40 \% of testing and
   72.08 \% of training results of false absorption omission rate, 75.04 \%
   of testing and 73.19 \% of training results of absorbance prevalence
   threshold, and 90.81 \% of testing and 78.09 \% of training results of
   critical success index. The model also incorporates components such as
   insulation and orientation to further improve its accuracy in predicting
   the amount of thermal energy that can be harvested. Solar absorbers are
   used in industrial environments to absorb the sun's radiation and turn
   it into thermal energy. This thermal energy can then be used to power
   things such as heating and cooling systems, air compressors, and even
   some types of manufacturing operations. By using a solar deep learning
   model, businesses can accurately predict how much thermal energy can be
   harvested from a particular solar absorber before making an investment

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Wind energy, as a kind of environmentally friendly renewable energy, has
   attracted a lot of attention in recent decades. However, the security
   and stability of the power system is potentially affected by large-scale
   wind power grid due to the randomness and intermittence of wind speed.
   Therefore, accurate wind speed prediction is conductive to power system
   operation. A hybrid wind speed prediction model based on Improved
   Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise
   (ICEEMDAN), Multiscale Fuzzy Entropy (MFE), Long short-term memory
   (LSTM) and INFORMER is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the wind speed
   data are decomposed into multiple intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by
   ICEEMDAN. Then, the MFE values of each mode are calculated, and the
   modes with similar MFE values are aggregated to obtain new subsequences.
   Finally, each subsequence is predicted by informer and LSTM, each
   sequence selects the one with better performance than the two
   predictors, and the prediction results of each subsequence are
   superimposed to obtain the final prediction results. The proposed hybrid
   model is also compared with other seven related models based on four
   evaluation metrics under different prediction periods to verify its
   validity and applicability. The experimental results indicate that the
   proposed hybrid model based on ICEEMDAN, MFE, LSTM and INFORMER exhibits
   higher accuracy and greater applicability.},

Abstract = {The integration of photovoltaic energy into a grid demands accurate
   power output forecasting. In this research, an hour ahead prediction of
   power output is performed on an annual basis over real data period
   (2016-2019) for three different PV systems based on polycrystalline,
   monocrystalline, and thin-film technologies. The solar radiation,
   ambient temperature, module temperature and wind speed are the
   considered input parameters, while the power output of each PV system is
   the output parameter. A hybrid deep learning (DL) method (SSA-RNN-LSTM)
   is proposed for an hour ahead prediction of output power for each PV
   system. The proposed technique is compared with GA-RNN-LSTM,
   PSO-RNN-LSTM and RNN-LSTM. The considered forecasting accuracy

   determination (R-2). The findings elaborate that SSA-RNN-LSTM has shown
   better forecasting accuracy with the lowest (RMSE and MSE), highest

Abstract = {Machine learning (ML) classifiers were used as a novel approach to
   select the best operating mode for Hybrid Solar Chimney Power Plant
   (HSCPP). The classifiers (decision tree (J48), Nave Bayes (NB), and
   Support Vector Machines (SVM)) were developed to identify the best
   operating modes of the HSCPP based on meteorological data sets. The
   HSCPP uses solar irradiation (SolarRad) to function as a power plant
   (PP) during the day and as a cooling tower (CT) at night. The SVM is the
   best classifier to predict the operating mode of HSCPP with an accuracy
   of similar to 2\% compared to NB and J48. Under the studied conditions
   the Regression analysis using REPTree was found to outperform SMOreg and
   achieved a relative absolute error similar to 20 kWh. The productivity
   of the HSCPP is highly affected by maximum air temperature
   (T-air,T-Max), the average temperature of air (T (air,Avg)), solar
   irradiation standard deviation (SolarRad(STD)), and maximum wind speed
   (W-sp,W-Max). Under optimal conditions, the HSCPP generates an
   additional 2.5\% of energy equivalent to revenue of \$3910.5 per year.
   Results show that ML can be used to optimize the operation of HSCPP for
   maximum electrical power and distilled water production.},

Abstract = {The renewable energy industry is rapidly expanding due to environmental
   pollution from fossil fuels and continued price hikes. In particular,
   the solar energy sector accounts for about 48.7\% of renewable energy,
   at the highest production ratio. Therefore, climate prediction is
   essential because solar power is affected by weather and climate change.
   However, solar radiation, which is most closely related to solar power,
   is not currently predicted by the Korea Meteorological Administration;
   therefore, solar radiation prediction technology is needed. In this
   study, we predict solar radiation using extra-atmospheric solar
   radiation and three weather variables: temperature, relative humidity,
   and total cloud volume. We compared the performance of single models of
   machine and deep learning in previous work. For the single-model
   comparison, we used boosting techniques, such as extreme gradient
   boosting and categorical boosting (CatBoost) in machine learning, and
   the recurrent neural network (RNN) family (long short-term memory and
   gated recurrent units). In this paper, we compare CatBoost (previously
   the best model) with CNN and present a CNN-CatBoost hybrid model
   prediction method that combines CatBoost in machine learning and CNN in
   deep learning for the best predictive performance for a single-model
   comparison. In addition, we checked the accuracy change when adding wind
   speed and precipitation to the hybrid model. The model that considers
   wind speed and precipitation improved at all but three (Gangneung,
   Suwon, and Cheongju) of the 18 locations.},

Abstract = {In response to the growing demand for the global energy supply chain,
   wind power has become an important research subject among studies in the
   advancement of renewable energy sources. The major concern is the
   stochastic volatility of weather conditions that hinder the development
   of wind power forecasting approaches. To address this issue, the current
   study proposes a weather prediction method divided into two models for
   wind speed and atmospheric system forecasting. First, the data-based
   model incorporated with wavelet transform and recurrent neural networks
   is employed to predict the wind speed. Second, the physics-informed echo
   state network was used to learn the chaotic behavior of the atmospheric
   system. The findings were validated with a case study conducted on wind
   speed data from Turkmenistan. The results suggest the outperformance of
   physics-informed model for accurate and reliable forecasting analysis,
   which indicates the potential for implementation in wind energy
   analysis.},

Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {232},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are proposed for sizing and simulating
   a clean energy community (CEC) that employs a PV-wind hybrid system,
   coupled with energy storage systems and electric vehicle charging
   stations, to meet the building district energy demand. The first ANN is
   used to forecast the energy performance indicators, which are satisfied
   load fraction and the utilization factor of the energy generated, while
   the second ANN is used to estimate the grid energy indication factor.
   ANNs are trained with a very large database in any climatic conditions
   and for a flexible power system configuration and varying electrical
   loads. They directly predict the yearly CEC energy performance without
   performing any system dynamic simulations using sophisticated models of
   each CEC component. Only eight dimen-sionless input parameters are
   required, such as the fractions of wind and battery power installed,
   yearly mean and standard deviation values of the total horizontal solar
   radiation, wind speed, air temperature and load. The Garson algorithm
   was applied for the evaluation of each input influence on each output.
   Optimized ANNs are composed of a single hidden layer with twenty
   neurons, which leads to a very high prediction accuracy of CECs which
   are different from those used in ANN training. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {A novel short-term solar power prediction model is presented in this
   work, by utilizing the learning ability of Long-Shot-Term-Memory network
   (LSTM) based deep learning (DL) technique and the concept of wavelet

Abstract = {Renewable energy (RE) offers major environmental and economic benefits
   compared to nuclear and fuel-based energy; however, the data used for RE
   include significant randomness, intermittent behaviour, and
   strong-volatility, hindering their integration into smart grids.
   Accurate RE prediction is a promising solution to this problem and can
   provide effective planning and management services. Various predictive
   models have been developed to improve the prediction performance for
   better energy management. However, current works focus on improving the
   prediction accuracy, which is a requirement of power systems, without
   considering the time complexity of their methodologies. Considering
   these limitations, we develop a lightweight ESNCNN model for accurate RE
   prediction, in which an ESN learns the nonlinear mapping relationship
   and a CNN extracts the spatial information from RE data. The ESN and CNN
   layers are linearly connected via residual connections to avoid the
   vanishing gradient problem. Finally, we incorporate fully connected
   layers to enhance and select the optimal ESNCNN features to predict the
   future energy production. Our ESNCNN model is evaluated based on RE
   benchmarks, using various evaluation metrics such as MSE, MBE, MAE and
   RMSE, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further experiments are
   performed with different machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid
   models to select the optimum model. To fully assess the generalisation
   ability of the proposed ESNCNN, additional experiments are performed
   over electricity consumption datasets, which reveal an extensive
   decrease in error rates compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
   Our model therefore represents a new paradigm for finding an energy
   equilibrium between grid and energy production resources using a single
   ESNCNN platform. Our results indicate a substantial reduction in the
   error rates over the RE dataset (MSE (5.01\%), MAE (5.49\%), and RMSE
   (3.76\%)) and the electricity consumption dataset (MSE (5.37\%), MAE
   (7.63\%), RMSE (0.047\%), and MBE (1.2\%)). (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Abstract = {Digital hydraulics is a potential technology for the Hydraulic Pitch
   System (HPS) in Wind Turbine (WT). Digital Hydraulics Pitch System
   (DHPS) uses Digital Flow Control Units (DFCU) to develop the precise
   pitching action. In this paper, a novel Intelligent Digital Pitch
   Controller (IDPC) is proposed. The proposed controller is designed and
   implemented on a developed lab-scale DHPS Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
   simulator. The various parameters of DHPS-hardware were designed using
   the bottom-up design methodology. The IDPC comprises Machine Learning
   (ML)-based WECS and DHPS controllers in the outer and inner loop
   respectively. HIL simulations were conducted with the implemented IDPC.
   The ML-based WECS controller predicts the reference pitch angle close to
   its desired value. The ML-based DHPS controller predicts the states of
   DFCU to develop real-time pitching action in DHPS-hardware. Several case
   studies were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   IDPC. A study shows that IDPC controlled DHPS exhibits better
   performance than an ML-Proportional Integral (PI) controlled HPS with
   proportional flow control valve. Subsequently, the performance of the
   IDPC is compared with PI-ML cascade controller. This study shows that
   the Maximum Absolute Error (MAE) between the generator speed and its
   rated speed is 0.87\% and 19.29\% for the proposed controller and PI-ML
   cascade controller, respectively. Similarly, MAE (error between
   generator torque and its rated torque) of torque is 0.85\% and 5.46\%
   for the proposed controller and PI-ML cascade controller, respectively.
   Thus, the implementation of the IDPC develops optimal power with minimal
   speed/torque fluctuations.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the development of a wind power forecasting model
   based on gene expression programming (GEP) for one of the major wind
   farms in Sri Lanka, Pawan Danavi. With the ever-increasing demand for
   renewable power generation, Sri Lanka has started harnessing electricity
   from wind power. Though the initial establishment cost of wind farms is
   high, the analyses clearly showcased the economic sustainability of wind
   power generation in long term. In this context, forecasting the wind
   power generation at Sri Lankan wind farms is important in many ways.
   However, limited research has been carried out in Sri Lanka to predict
   the wind power generation against the changing climate. Therefore, to
   overcome this research gap, a model was developed to forecast wind power
   generation against two climatic factors, viz. on-site wind speed and
   ambient temperature. The results showcased the robustness and accuracy
   of the proposed GEP-based forecasting model (with R-2 = 0.92, index of
   agreement = 0.98, and RMSE = 259 kW). Moreover, the results of the study
   were compared against three different forecasting models and found
   comparable in terms of the model accuracy. The GEP-based model is
   advantageous over machine learning techniques due to its capability in
   deriving a mathematical expression. As an acceptable relationship was
   found between wind power generation and climatic factors, the proposed
   model facilitates the future projection of wind power generations with
   forecasted climatic factors. Though the application of GEP in the field
   of wind power generation is reported in a few research publications,
   this is the first research in which GEP is employed to model the power
   generation with respect to weather indices. The proposed prediction
   model is advantageous than machine learning models as the relationship
   between the wind power and the weather indices can be expressed.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Introduction: Wind speed and solar radiation are two of the most
   well-known and widely used renewable energy sources worldwide. Coal,
   natural gas, and petroleum are examples of fossil fuels that are not
   replenished and are thus non-renewable energy sources due to their high
   carbon content and the methods by which they are generated. To predict
   energy production of renewable sources, researchers use energy
   forecasting techniques based on the recent advances in machine learning
   approaches. Numerous prediction methods have significant drawbacks,
   including high computational complexity and inability to generalize for
   various types of sources of renewable energy sources. Methodology: In
   this paper, we proposed a novel approach capable of generalizing the
   prediction accuracy for both wind speed and solar radiation forecasting
   data. The proposed approach is based on a new optimization algorithm and
   a new stacked ensemble model. The new optimization algorithm is a hybrid
   of Al-Biruni Earth Radius (BER) and genetic algorithm (GA) and it is
   denoted by the GABER optimization algorithm. This algorithm is used to
   optimize the parameters of the proposed stacked ensemble model to boost
   the prediction accuracy and to improve the generalization capability.
   Results: To evaluate the proposed approach, several experiments are
   conducted to study its effectiveness and superiority compared to other
   optimization methods and forecasting models. In addition, statistical
   tests are conducted to assess the significance and difference of the
   proposed approach. The recorded results proved the proposed approach's
   superiority, effectiveness, generalization, and statistical significance
   when compared to state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: The proposed
   approach is capable of predicting both wind speed and solar radiation
   with better generalization.},

Title = {Bilateral Gaussian Wake Model Formulation for Wind Farms: A Forecasting
   based approach},
Journal = {RENEWABLE \& SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {127},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Optimal placement of turbines in a wind farm is a major challenge where
   the wake effect reduces the effective wind power capture. Wind speed
   prediction is essential from a reliability point of view. In this
   article, a bilateral wake model which is derived from two benchmark
   models, namely, Jensen's and Frandsen's variation is used for studying
   the performance of far-end wakes. A prediction based approach is
   formulated wherein the inputs to the classical SVR model are based on
   the two benchmark models and the proposed bilateral Gaussian wake model.
   Wind speed is predicted for upstream turbines of two wind farm layouts
   (5-turbine and 15-turbine). Further, to observe the impact of input
   dimensionality, two techniques: (i) Grey relational analysis (GRA) and
   (ii) Neighborhood component analysis (NCA), are considered. Results
   reveal that for a wind site WBZ tower, NCA outperforms GRA by 36.48\%,
   34.0\% and 7.03\% for Jensen's, Frandsen's and bilateral wake model
   respectively. When compared to the two benchmark models for both the
   techniques (GRA and NCA), the prediction performance of bilateral wake
   model is superior. Overall, it is observed that the feature selection
   tools like GRA and NCA improve the wind speed prediction accuracy in the
   presence of wind wakes.},

Abstract = {Nationwide, hourly-averaged solar plus wind power generation (MW) data
   compiled for Germany for year 2016 is evaluated with ten influencing
   variables. Those variables cover, on an hourly basis, weather and
   ground-surface conditions and electricity prices. The transparent open
   box (TOB) algorithm accurately predicts and forecasts power generation
   (MW) for this dataset (prediction RMSE = 1175 MW and R-2 = 0.9804; hour
   ahead forecast RMSE = 1632 MW and R-2 = 0.9609) and meaningfully data
   mines the prediction outliers. Some 1.5 \% of the data records display
   significant prediction errors. These records are mined to reveal that
   many of them form trends on a few specific days displaying unusual and
   rapidly changing weather conditions. Derivatives of ground level solar
   radiation, wind velocity and air pressure can meaningfully distinguish
   such unusual conditions and can be used to filter the dataset to further
   improve prediction accuracy. Derivatives and ratios of variables are
   also exploited to focus and modify feature selection for TOB analysis on
   approximately 10 \% of the dataset (900 data records) responsible for
   the least accurate predictions. This more focused feature selection
   improves prediction accuracy for these more difficult to predict data
   records (RMSE improves from 3544 to 2630 MW; R-2 from 0.8027 to 0.8938).},

Abstract = {Road vehicles, particularly cars, are one of the primary sources of CO2
   emissions in the transport sector. Shifting to unconventional energy
   sources such as solar and wind power may reduce their carbon footprints
   considerably. Consequently, using ammonia as a fuel due to its potential
   benefits, such as its high energy density, being a carbon-free fuel, and
   its versatility during storage and transportation, has now grabbed the
   attention of researchers. However, its slow combustion speed, larger
   combustion chamber requirements, ignition difficulties, and limited
   combustion stability are still major challenges. Therefore, authors
   tried to analyze the combustion pressure of ammonia in a constant-volume
   combustion chamber across different equivalence ratios by adopting a
   machine learning approach. While conducting the analysis, the
   experimental values were assessed and subsequently utilized to predict
   the induced combustion pressure in a constant-volume combustion chamber
   across various equivalence ratios. In this research, a two-step
   prediction process was employed. In the initial step, the Random Forest
   algorithm was applied to assess the combustion pressure. Subsequently,
   in the second step, artificial neural network machine learning
   algorithms were employed to pinpoint the most effective algorithm with a
   lower root-mean-square error and R2. Finally, Linear Regression
   illustrated the lowest error in both steps with a value of 1.0, followed
   by Random Forest.},

Title = {Power enhancement of vertical axis wind turbine using optimum trapped
   vortex cavity},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {278},
Number = {A},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (VAWT) blades experience stall conditions at
   lower tip speed ratios during rotation, resulting in inefficient power
   performance. The power performance can be augmented by improving the
   blade's aerodynamic efficiency using active or/and passive flow control
   mechanisms. In this research, the power per-formance of 2-D H-type VAWT
   is enhanced by employing an optimum cavity on the suction side of the
   NACA 0018 blade airfoil. The optimum cavity shape was found using the
   Genetic Algorithm coupled with the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
   model at an airfoil static stall angle of attack in an isolated
   environment to reduce the computational cost of the optimization
   process. Two GPR models were employed to predict lift and drag
   co-efficients, while the lift-to-drag ratio was used as an objective
   function in the optimization algorithm. 80 CFD runs were utilized for
   initial training and testing of the models, which reduced computational
   effort by 97\% compared to a pure CFD-based optimization approach. The
   aerodynamic efficiency of the optimum cavity shape predicted by GPR
   models was also confirmed by CFD simulation, which showed only a 0.5\%
   difference. For an airfoil with an optimum cavity, the aerodynamic
   efficiency was consistent at lower angles of attack. However, a
   significant rise of up to 31.8\% was observed in the near stall region
   between 12 degrees to 16 degrees angle of attack in comparison to clean
   airfoil. The optimum cavity on baseline VAWT blades enhanced power
   performance by 63.8\% at a TSR of 1.5. Moreover, at TSRs of 2, 2.5, 3,
   and 3.5, the enhancement in power performance was achieved by 34.4\%,
   22.2\%, 16.1\%, and 3.2\%, respectively. This demonstrates the potential
   of employing an optimum cavity on the suction side for performance
   augmentation without applying the suction and a cost-effective solution
   by conducting optimization in an isolated environment.},

Title = {Data-driven modelling of turbine wake interactions and flow resistance
   in large wind farms},
Journal = {WIND ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Pages = {968-984},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Turbine wake and local blockage effects are known to alter wind farm
   power production in two different ways: (1) by changing the wind speed
   locally in front of each turbine and (2) by changing the overall flow
   resistance in the farm and thus the so-called farm blockage effect. To
   better predict these effects with low computational costs, we develop
   data-driven emulators of the `local' or `internal' turbine thrust
   coefficient C-T({*}) as a function of turbine layout. We train the model
   using a multi-fidelity Gaussian process (GP) regression with a
   combination of low (engineering wake model) and high-fidelity (large
   eddy simulations) simulations of farms with different layouts and wind
   directions. A large set of low-fidelity data speeds up the learning
   process and the high-fidelity data ensures a high accuracy. The trained
   multi-fidelity GP model is shown to give more accurate predictions of
   C-T({*}) compared to a standard (single-fidelity) GP regression applied
   only to a limited set of high-fidelity data. We also use the
   multi-fidelity GP model of C-T({*}) with the two-scale momentum theory
   (Nishino \&Dunstan 2020, J. Fluid Mech. 894, A2) to demonstrate that the
   model can be used to give fast and accurate predictions of large wind
   farm performance under various mesoscale atmospheric conditions. This
   new approach could be beneficial for improving annual energy production
   (AEP) calculations and farm optimization in the future.},

Title = {Hybrid forecasting system considering the influence of seasonal factors
   under energy sustainable development goals},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {211},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As environmental concerns and the energy crisis intensify, advancing the
   use of new energy sources such as wind and photovoltaic is an important
   means to achieve sustainable energy development. However, the random
   fluctuation characteristics and seasonality of wind and light make them
   difficult to predict, which brings many operational risks to grid
   security and power dispatch. Therefore, this paper uses the Complete
   Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) as
   the decomposition algorithm, which can effectively avoid the problems of
   modal confusion and noise residuals and better identify the trend,
   seasonality and nonlinear characteristics of the series. The Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is also utilized to improve the
   prediction accuracy and stability of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM).
   Combining CEEMDAN and PSO-ELM models, a high-precision hybrid
   forecasting system that can effectively reduce the effects of
   sto-chastic fluctuations is proposed. In this paper, wind speed data
   from four different seasons at Changma wind farm in China are selected
   to verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of this hybrid
   prediction system. The results show that the improvement of ELM by PSO
   and CEEMDAN significantly improves the prediction accuracy of the model,
   and the hybrid prediction system can be applied to time series with
   different data characteristics and variation patterns in each season,
   and its prediction accuracy and model performance are significantly
   better than other comparative models.},

Title = {Predicting electricity infrastructure induced wildfire risk in
   California},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {This paper examines the use of risk models to predict the timing and
   location of wildfires caused by electricity infrastructure. Our data
   include historical ignition and wire-down points triggered by grid
   infrastructure collected between 2015-2019 in Pacific Gas \& Electricity
   territory along with various weather, vegetation, and very high
   resolution data on grid infrastructure including location, age, and
   materials. With these data we explore a range of machine learning
   methods and strategies to manage training data imbalance. The best area
   under the receiver operating characteristic we obtain is 0.776 for
   distribution feeder ignitions and 0.824 for transmission line wire-down
   events, both using the histogram-based gradient boosting tree algorithm
   with under-sampling. We then use these models to identify which
   information provides the most predictive value. After line length, we
   find that weather and vegetation features dominate the list of top
   important features for ignition or wire-down risk. Distribution ignition
   models show more dependence on slow-varying vegetation variables such as
   burn index, energy release content, and tree height, whereas
   transmission wire-down models rely more on primary weather variables
   such as wind speed and precipitation. These results point to the
   importance of improved vegetation modeling for feeder ignition risk
   models, and improved weather forecasting for transmission wire-down
   models. We observe that infrastructure features make small but
   meaningful improvements to risk model predictive power.},

Journal = {ENERGIES},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Incorporating solar energy into a grid necessitates an accurate power
   production forecast for photovoltaic (PV) facilities. In this research,
   output PV power was predicted at an hour ahead on yearly basis for three
   different PV plants based on polycrystalline (p-si), monocrystalline
   (m-si), and thin-film (a-si) technologies over a four-year period. Wind
   speed, module temperature, ambiance, and solar irradiation were among
   the input characteristics taken into account. Each PV plant power output
   was the output parameter. A deep learning method (RNN-LSTM) was
   developed and evaluated against existing techniques to forecast the PV
   output power of the selected PV plant. The proposed technique was
   compared with regression (GPR, GPR (PCA)), hybrid ANFIS (grid
   partitioning, subtractive clustering and FCM) and machine learning (ANN,
   SVR, SVR (PCA)) methods. Furthermore, different LSTM structures were
   also investigated, with recurrent neural networks (RNN) based on 2019
   data to determine the best structure. The following parameters of
   prediction accuracy measure were considered: RMSE, MSE, MAE, correlation
   (r) and determination (R-2) coefficients. In comparison to all other
   approaches, RNN-LSTM had higher prediction accuracy on the basis of
   minimum (RMSE and MSE) and maximum (r and R-2). The p-si, m-si and a-si
   PV plants showed the lowest RMSE values of 26.85 W/m(2), 19.78 W/m(2)
   and 39.2 W/m(2) respectively. Moreover, the proposed method was found to
   be robust and flexible in forecasting the output power of the three
   considered different photovoltaic plants.},

   learning},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY FOCUS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {34},
Pages = {69-90},

Abstract = {German wind power (MW) generated on an hourly basis is evaluated in
   terms of weather-environmental-market related inputs using 8784 data
   records for the year 2016. An optimized data-matching algorithm achieves
   high degrees of accuracy predicting MW from a diverse set of inputs
   across the year and forecasting MW in the short-term using only
   historical inputs. The developed algorithm demonstrates its value by
   enabling detailed auditable data mining of all data record predictions
   and forecasts and providing forensic knowledge of the dataset. The
   method initially identifies the most closely matching data records using
   squared differences between each of the inputs included in its feature
   selection. Subsequently, it applies standard and memetic optimizers to
   minimize the squared errors for its MW forecasts by tuning a small
   subset of only similar to 150 data records (similar to 1.7\% of all data
   records). It then selects the best optimum solution based on evaluations
   with a set of data records held independently from the tuning process.
   The accuracy realized for the best solution determined, applied using
   all data records, is RMSE = 791.4 MW and R-2 = 0.988. The dataset has a
   few significant MW prediction outliers. Detailed auditable analysis of
   the prediction outliers identifies and explains their causes. The method
   also provides high forecasting accuracy and data insight for short-term
   time series data. It achieves one hour ahead (t + 1) forecasting
   accuracies of RMSE = 879.5 MW; R-2 = 0.9802, and three hour ahead (t +
   3) forecasting accuracies of RMSE = 1880.1 MW; R-2 = 0.9095 using just
   1000 h of historical data records.},

   Neural Network and high-fidelity LES data},
Journal = {ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {258},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Wake interactions between wind turbines have a great impact on the
   overall performance of a wind farm. In this work, a novel deep learning
   method, called Bilateral Convolutional Neural Network (BiCNN), is
   proposed and then employed to accurately model dynamic wind farm wakes
   based on flow field data generated by high-fidelity simulations.
   Different from the existing machine-learning-based dynamic wake models
   where dimensionality reduction is essential, the proposed BiCNN is
   designed to directly process the different types of inputs through a
   background path and a foreground path, thus avoiding the errors due to
   dimensionality reduction. Substantial results show that the developed
   machine learning based wake model can achieve accurate wake predictions
   in real time, i.e. it captures the spatial variations of the dynamic
   wakes similarly as high-fidelity wake models and runs as fast as
   low-fidelity static wake models. The overall prediction error of the
   developed model is 3.7\% with respect to the freestream wind speed.
   Furthermore, the results for a test farm consisting of 25 turbines show
   that the developed model can predict the dynamic wind farm wakes within
   several seconds using a standard laptop, while the same scenario using
   high-fidelity numerical models would consume tens of thousands of CPU
   hours.},

Title = {Energetic Electron Flux Predictions in the Near-Earth Plasma Sheet From
   Solar Wind Driving},

Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Suprathermal electrons in the near-Earth plasma sheet are important for
   inner magnetosphere considerations. They are the source population for
   outer radiation belt electrons and they pose risks to geosynchronous
   satellites through their contribution to surface charging. We use
   empirical modeling to address relationships between solar driving
   parameters and plasma sheet electron flux. Using Time History of Events
   and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms, OMNI, and Flare Irradiance
   Spectral Model Version 2 data, we develop a neural network model to
   predict differential electron flux from 0.08 to 93 keV in the plasma
   sheet, at distances from 6 to 12 R-E. Driving parameters include solar
   wind (SW) density and speed, interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B-Z and
   B-Y, solar extreme ultraviolet flux, IMF B-Z ultra-low frequency (ULF)
   wave power, SW-magnetosphere coupling functions P-alpha 1 and NXCF, and
   the 4-hr time history of these parameters. Our model predicts overall
   plasma sheet electron flux variations with correlation coefficients of
   between 0.59 and 0.77, and median symmetric accuracy in the 41\%-140\%
   range (depending on energy). We find that short time-scale electron flux
   variations are not reproduced using short time-scale inputs. Using a
   recently published technique to extract information from neural
   networks, we determine the most important drivers impacting model
   prediction are V-SW, VBS, and IMF B-Z. SW-magnetosphere coupling
   functions that include IMF clock angle, IMF B-Z ULF wave power, and IMF
   B-Y have little impact in our model of electron flux in the near-Earth
   plasma sheet. The new model, built directly on differential flux,
   outperforms an existing model that derives fluxes from plasma moments,
   with the performance improvement increasing with increasing energy.},

Abstract = {Today, Solar Photovoltaic (SPV) energy, an advancing and attractive
   clean technology with zero carbon emissions, is widely used. It is
   crucial to pay serious attention to the maintenance and application of
   Solar Power Generation (SPG) to harness it effectively. The design was
   more costly, and the automatic monitoring is not precise. The main
   objective of the work related to designed and built up the Internet of
   Things (IoT) platform to monitor the SPV Power Plants (SPVPP) to solve
   the issue. IoT platform designing and Data Analytics (DA) are the two
   phases of the proposed methodology. For building the IoT device in the
   IoT platform designing phase, diverse lower-cost sensors with higher
   end-to-end delivery ratio, higher network lifetime, throughput, residual
   energy, and better energy consumption are considered. Then, Sigfox
   communication technology is employed at the Low-Power Wireless Area
   Network (LPWAN) communication layer for lower-cost communication.
   Therefore, in the DA phase, the sensor monitored values are evaluated.
   In the analysis phase, which is the most significant part of the work,
   the input data are first pre-processed to avoid errors. Next, to monitor
   the Energy Loss (EL), the fault, and Potential Energy (PE), the solar
   features are extracted as of the pre-processed data. The significance of
   utilizing the Transformation Search centered Seagull Optimization (TSSO)
   algorithm, the significant features are chosen as of the extracted
   features. Therefore, the computational time of the solar monitoring has
   been decreased by the Feature Selection (FS). Next, the features are
   input into the Gaussian Kernelized Deep Learning Neural Network (GKDLNN)
   algorithm, which predicts the faults, PE, and EL. In the experimental
   evaluation, solar generation is assessed based on Wind Speed (WS),
   temperature, time, and Global Solar Radiation (GSR). The systems are
   satisfactory and produce more power during the time interval from 12:00
   PM to 1:00 PM. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated based
   on performance metrics and compared with existing research techniques.
   When compared to these techniques, the proposed framework achieves
   superior results with improved precision, accuracy, F-measure, and
   recall.},

Title = {Random Forest Model of Ultralow-Frequency Magnetospheric Wave Power},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Models of magnetospheric ultralow-frequency (ULF) waves can be used to
   study wave phenomena and to calculate the effect of these waves on the
   energization and transport of radiation belt electrons. We present a
   decision tree ensemble (i.e., a random forest) model of ground-based ULF
   wave power spectral density driven by solar wind speed v(sw),
   north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field Bz, and
   variance of proton number density var(Np). This model corresponds to
   four radial locations in the magnetosphere (roughly L similar to 4.21 to
   7.94) and spans 1-15 mHz, with hourly magnetic local time resolution.
   The decision tree ensembles are easier to use than the previous model
   generation; they have better coverage, perform better at predicting
   power, and have reduced error due to intelligently chosen bins in
   parameter space. We outline the difficulties in extracting physics from
   parameterized models and demonstrate a hypothesis testing framework to
   iteratively explore finer driving processes. We confirm a regime change
   for ULF driving about Bz = 0. We posit that ULF wave power directly
   driven by magnetopause perturbations corresponds to a latitude-dependent
   dawn-dusk asymmetry, which we see with increasing speed. Model
   uncertainty identifies where the underlying physics is not fully
   captured; we find that power due to substorms is less well characterized
   by Bz > 0, with an effect that is seen globally and not just near
   midnight. The largest uncertainty is seen for the smallest amounts of
   solar wind driving, suggesting that internal magnetospheric properties
   may play a significant role in ULF wave occurrence.
   Plain LanguageSummary To describe the energy and motion of electrons in
   the radiation belts for space weather modeling purposes, we need to be
   able to describe the large-scale ultralow-frequency plasma waves. These
   waves can energize and transport high-energy electrons, which pose a
   hazard to spacecraft. Using ground-based magnetometers whose
   observations directly correspond to waves in space, we construct a
   machine learning model that predicts power in those waves based on
   incoming solar wind properties. This performs better than the previous
   model and is more easily used to investigate the physics. We demonstrate
   how to use it to explore the physics by comparing it to existing wave
   phenomena. We find that the solar wind drives it in the ways expected
   but that we should not average over these processes as some of them have
   a significant on/off switch. We find that two aspects of magnetospheric
   physics are not fully captured in our model and contribute to the
   remaining uncertainty: the effect of substorms throughout the
   magnetosphere and the internal state of the magnetosphere. These are
   likely to have a significant additional impact on wave occurrence.},

Title = {Hybrid Gaussian process regression and Fuzzy Inference System based
   approach for condition monitoring at the rotor side of a doubly fed
   induction generator},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {936-946},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {With the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in condition monitoring
   (CM) of wind turbines (WTs), regression-based approaches are mainly for
   WT power curve modelling to evaluate its performance. A fitted
   performance curve (PC) of power versus wind speed is prevailing and
   straightforward for WT performance monitoring. As WT operations could be
   affected by multiple parameters. It is difficult to identify the fault
   type merely by a power curve. Particularly at the rotor side of doubly
   fed induction generator (DFIG), there are miscellaneous electrical
   disturbances that have their distinct effects on current signals. Hence,
   by merely processing the rotor currents, a PC of standard deviation of
   currents versus wind speed can be employed for CM of rotor-side faults.
   A non-parametric regression model, Gaussian process regression (GPR), is
   used to predict the PC under normal operation, and afterwards, Fuzzy
   Inference System (FIS) is applied for fault diagnosis. Therefore, the
   paper proposes a hybrid GPR and FIS approach towards condition
   monitoring (CM) and fault diagnosis at the rotor side of a DFIG by
   merely processing rotor currents through various signal processing
   techniques, where miscellaneous electrical disturbances can be
   recognized and localized. The comparative results show that the hybrid
   approach has superiority over two common ML classifiers, support vector
   machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT), for fault diagnosis under both
   test cases including drift faults and excluding drift faults. By
   disregarding drift faults, this hybrid approach is validated to be
   efficient for a real-time application with overall promising performance
   metrics in terms of accuracy (98.29\%), dependability (98.12\%), and
   security (100\%). The diagnosed results on individual faults and
   research shortcomings are also discussed.},

Volume = {18},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Voltage control is desirable for voltage stability of an electrical
   power system. Isolated high renewable energy grids have become a common
   phenomenon in the wake of the global shift to clean renewable energy
   sources (RES) fronted to achieve carbon neutrality. The most dominant
   RES are solar photovoltaic and wind energy which rely on switched
   power-electronic devices to cope with grid reactive power requirements.
   These devices often fall out of step with other synchronous generators
   due to the mismatch in synchronizing speed whenever a system disturbance
   occurs. Previous studies propose that voltage and frequency instability
   can be mitigated by the integration of a small modular reactor (SMR) in
   the RES grid. SMRs have load-following capability, reactive power
   compensation and supplementary voltage regulation capability; which is
   achieved using the main transformer's on-load tap changer (OLTC). This
   paper proposes application of advanced machine learning-based recurrent
   neural networks (RNN) for the SMR main transformer OLTC control by
   leveraging on multiple parameters to predict the appropriate percentage
   tap values. The RNN model is built and tested using simulation data
   obtained from load flow analysis using the electrical transient and

Abstract = {Forecasting air quality index (AQI) is critically important to provide a
   basis for government policy makers, especially in public health, smart
   transportation, energy management, economic development, and sustainable
   environments. In reality, AQI consists of various components, such as
   PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, and SO2. Although numerous methods have been
   presented, few studies concurrently considered the causalities of
   socioeconomic indicators and meteorological factors and different data
   granularities. The aggregate AQI of Taiwan comprises five representative
   cities: Taipei, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan, and Kaohsiung. Research
   findings identify seasonal factors, carbon power generation, steel and
   metal production, highway cargo load, the number of registered cars, and
   retail and manufacturing employment population as the key indicators to
   predict the monthly AQI of Taiwan. For the daily AQI of Hsinchu and the
   hourly AQI of Kaohsiung, PM2.5, PM10, O-3, ambient temperature,
   humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and pollutants (CO, NO2, and SO2)
   are recognized. Deep learning significantly outperforms machine learning
   in the hourly AQI while it performs slightly better in the daily AQI.
   With the presented framework, governments can balance the trade-offs
   between economic development and environmental sustainability.},

Title = {Cloud cover bias correction in numerical weather models for solar energy
   monitoring and forecasting systems with kernel ridge regression},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {203},
Pages = {113-130},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Prediction of Total Cloud Cover (TCDC) from numerical weather simulation
   models, such as Global Forecast System (GFS), can aid renewable energy
   engineers in monitoring and forecasting solar photovoltaic power
   generation. A major challenge is the systematic bias in TCDC simulations
   induced by the errors in the numerical model parameterization stages.
   Correction of GFS-derived cloud forecasts at multiple time steps can
   improve energy forecasts in electricity grids to bring better grid
   stability or certainty in the supply of solar energy. We propose a new
   kernel ridge regression (KRR) model to reduce bias in TCDC simulations
   for medium-term prediction at the inter-daily, e.g., 2-8 day-ahead
   predicted TCDC values. The proposed KRR model is evaluated against
   multivariate recursive nesting bias correction (MRNBC), a conventional
   approach and eight machine learning (ML) methods. In terms of the mean
   absolute error (MAE), the proposed KRR model outperforms MRNBC and ML
   models at 2-8 day ahead forecasts, with MAE approximate to 20-27\%. A
   notable reduction in the simulated cloud cover mean bias error of
   20-50\% is achieved against the MRNBC and reference accuracy values
   generated using proxy-observed and non-corrected GFS-predicted TCDC in
   the model's testing phase. The study ascertains that the proposed KRR
   model can be explored further to operationalize its capabilities, reduce
   uncertainties in weather simulation models, and its possible
   consideration for practical use in improving solar monitoring and
   forecasting systems that utilize cloud cover simulations from numerical
   weather predictions.},

Abstract = {Evapotranspiration is an important quantity required in many
   applications, such as hydrology and agricultural and irrigation
   planning. Reference evapotranspiration is particularly important, and
   the prediction of its variations is beneficial for analyzing the needs
   and management of water resources. In this paper, we explore the
   predictive ability of hybrid ensemble learning to predict daily
   reference evapotranspiration (RET) under the semi-arid climate by using
   meteorological datasets at 12 locations in the Andalusia province in
   southern Spain. The datasets comprise mean, maximum, and minimum air
   temperatures and mean relative humidity and mean wind speed. A new
   modified variant of the grey wolf optimizer, named the PRSFGWO
   algorithm, is proposed to maximize the ensemble learning's prediction
   accuracy through optimal weight tuning and evaluate the proposed model's
   capacity when the climate data is limited. The performance of the
   proposed approach, based on weighted ensemble learning, is compared with
   various algorithms commonly adopted in relevant studies. A diverse set
   of statistical measurements alongside ANOVA tests was used to evaluate
   the predictive performance of the prediction models. The proposed model
   showed high-accuracy statistics, with relative root mean errors lower
   than 0.999\% and a minimum R-2 of 0.99. The model inputs were also
   reduced from six variables to only two for cost-effective predictions of
   daily RET. This shows that the PRSFGWO algorithm is a good RET
   prediction model for the semi-arid climate region in southern Spain. The
   results obtained from this research are very promising compared with
   existing models in the literature.},

   Design and Project Risk Assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},

Abstract = {Best practices and international standards for determining n-year return
   period extreme wave (sea states) conditions allow wave energy converter
   designers and project developers the option to apply simple univariate
   or more complex bivariate extreme value analysis methods. The present
   study compares extreme sea state estimates derived from univariate and
   bivariate methods and investigates the performance of spectral wave
   models for predicting extreme sea states at buoy locations within
   several regional wave climates along the US East and West Coasts. Two
   common third-generation spectral wave models are evaluated, a WAVEWATCH
   III (R) model with a grid resolution of 4 arc-minutes (6-7 km), and a
   Simulating WAves Nearshore model, with a coastal resolution of 200-300
   m. Both models are used to generate multi-year hindcasts, from which
   extreme sea state statistics used for wave conditions characterization
   can be derived and compared to those based on in-situ observations at
   National Data Buoy Center stations. Comparison of results using
   different univariate and bivariate methods from the same data source
   indicates reasonable agreement on average. Discrepancies are
   predominantly random. Large discrepancies are common and increase with
   return period. There is a systematic underbias for extreme significant
   wave heights derived from model hindcasts compared to those derived from
   buoy measurements. This underbias is dependent on model spatial
   resolution. However, simple linear corrections can effectively
   compensate for this bias. A similar approach is not possible for
   correcting model-derived environmental contours, but other methods,
   e.g., machine learning, should be explored.},

   Empirical Mode Decomposition and BO-LSTM Neural Networks},

Abstract = {Precise time series prediction serves as an important role in
   constructing a digital twin (DT). The various internal and external
   interferences result in highly nonlinear and stochastic time series.
   Although artificial neural networks (ANNs) are often used to forecast
   time series because of their strong self-learning and nonlinear fitting
   capabilities, it is a challenging and time-consuming task to obtain the
   optimal ANN architecture. This paper proposes a hybrid time series
   prediction model based on an ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD), long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and Bayesian
   optimization (BO). To improve the predictability of stochastic and
   nonstationary time series, the EEMD method is implemented to decompose
   the original time series into several components (each component is a
   single-frequency and stationary signal) and a residual signal. The
   decomposed signals are used to train the neural networks, in which the
   hyperparameters are fine-tuned by the BO algorithm. The following time
   series data are predicted by summating all the predictions of the
   decomposed signals based on the trained neural networks. To evaluate the
   performance of the proposed EEMD-BO-LSTM neural networks, this paper
   conducts two case studies (the wind speed prediction and the wave height
   prediction) and implements a comprehensive comparison between the
   proposed method and other approaches including the persistence model,
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, LSTM neural
   networks, BO-LSTM neural networks, and EEMD-LSTM neural networks. The
   results show an improved prediction accuracy using the proposed method
   by multiple accuracy metrics.},

Abstract = {We review the latest modeling techniques and propose new hybrid SAELSTM
   framework based on Deep Learning (DL) to construct prediction intervals
   for daily Global Solar Radiation (GSR) using the Manta Ray Foraging
   Optimization (MRFO) feature selection to select model parameters.
   Features are employed as potential inputs for Long Short-Term Memory and
   a seq2seq SAELSTM autoencoder Deep Learning (DL) system in the final GSR
   prediction. Six solar energy farms in Queensland, Australia are
   considered to evaluate the method with predictors from Global Climate
   Models and ground-based observation. Comparisons are carried out among
   DL models (i.e., Deep Neural Network) and conventional Machine Learning
   algorithms (i.e., Gradient Boosting Regression, Random Forest
   Regression, Extremely Randomized Trees, and Adaptive Boosting
   Regression). The hyperparameters are deduced with grid search, and
   simulations demonstrate that the DL hybrid SAELSTM model is accurate
   compared with the other models as well as the persistence methods. The
   SAELSTM model obtains quality solar energy prediction intervals with
   high coverage probability and low interval errors. The review and new
   modelling results utilising an autoencoder deep learning method show
   that our approach is acceptable to predict solar radiation, and
   therefore is useful in solar energy monitoring systems to capture the
   stochastic variations in solar power generation due to cloud cover,
   aerosols, ozone changes, and other atmospheric attenuation factors.},

Abstract = {With increasing demand for energy, the penetration of alternative
   sources such as renewable energy in power grids has increased. Solar
   energy is one of the most common and well-known sources of energy in
   existing networks. But because of its non-stationary and non-linear
   characteristics, it needs to predict solar irradiance to provide more
   reliable Photovoltaic (PV) plants and manage the power of supply and
   demand. Although there are various methods to predict the solar
   irradiance. This paper gives the overview of recent studies with focus
   on solar irradiance forecasting with ensemble methods which are divided
   into two main categories: competitive and cooperative ensemble
   forecasting. In addition, parameter diversity and data diversity are
   considered as competitive ensemble forecasting and also preprocessing
   and post-processing are as cooperative ensemble forecasting. All these
   ensemble forecasting methods are investigated in this study. In the end,
   the conclusion has been drawn and the recommendations for future studies
   have been discussed.},

Title = {Semi-real-time decision tree ensemble algorithms for very short-term
   solar irradiance forecasting},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {158},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Industrial activities are transitioning towards decarbonization,
   focusing on renewable energy sources, particularly photovoltaic solar
   energy. However, the inherent high variability of photovoltaic energy
   poses challenges. Some of them can be partially addressed by predicting
   electricity production, which in the case of photovoltaic solar energy
   is heavily based on solar irradiance prediction. Although extensive
   research has been conducted in this field, there is a noticeable gap in
   research regarding very short-term (intra-minute) forecasting under
   high-variability scenarios. In this proposal, real data from a
   photovoltaic solar plant in Alderville (Canada) were used to predict
   irradiance with a horizon of 15 and 30 s. The objective is to make this
   prediction in near-real time. To achieve this, we propose the use of
   machine learning algorithms based on decision tree ensembles, due to
   their low computational training cost and known effectiveness. On the
   other hand, we propose preprocessing the data through a temporal and
   spatial correlation analysis between measurements from different
   sensors. Feature selection analysis allows us to determine the direction
   of the wind and consequently identify the most relevant panels for model
   training. This preprocessing enhances the model retraining without the
   need for external information such as sky images or wind speed and
   direction on days with highly variable cloud cover. The presented
   methodology offers promising results with significantly reduced training
   times, demonstrating the suitability of this semi-online training
   approach for highly variable time series forecasting.},

Title = {Generation and validation of comprehensive synthetic weather histories
   using auto-regressive moving-average models},
Journal = {RENEWABLE ENERGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {224},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As energy system design moves to more complex methods of optimisation
   including machine learning there is a significant need for more weather
   data than is available. One method to solve this is using synthetic data
   models such as the auto -regressive moving -average (ARMA) model which
   has been frequently utilised to create such data. This paper looks at
   extending the ARMA algorithm to generate solar components through the
   use of clearsky detrending, maintaining vector relationships and by
   leveraging physical relationships. The method for the creation of
   entirely synthetic weather data files including key weather variables
   for energy system analysis is presented. Furthermore, a detailed
   comparison of energy system simulations utilising both real and
   synthetic data is made using NREL's System Advisor Model. Whilst good
   agreement is made for the solar variables, and other weather variables,
   ARMA methods often fail to capture the standard deviation and skew of
   annual weather distributions. Vector-ARMA is shown to maintain
   correlations between variables and thus generate data sets that perform
   similarly in energy system design. It is finally shown that the ARMA
   method fails to preserve day -today correlations in weather variables
   and thus over -predicts optimal energy storage by 21\% for a residential
   solar application.},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Photovoltaic systems (PV) have been extensively used worldwide as a
   reliable and effective renewable energy resource due to their
   environmental and economic merits. However, PV systems are prone to
   several environmental and weather conditions that impact their
   performance. Amongst these conditions is dust accumulation, which has a
   significant adversative impact on the solar cells' performance,
   especially in hot and arid regions. This study provides a comprehensive
   review of 278 articles focused on the impact of dust on PV panels'
   performance along with other associated environmental factors, such as
   temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The review highlights the
   importance of modelling dust accumulation along with other ecological
   factors due to their interactive nature, and the differences between
   cleaning techniques and schedules effectiveness. Moreover, the study
   provides a review of statistical and artificial intelligence models used
   to predict PV performance and its prediction accuracies in terms of data
   size and complexity. Finally, the study draws attention to several
   research gaps that warrant further investigation. Among these gaps is
   the need for proper dynamic optimisation models for cleaning schedules
   and a more advanced machine and deep learning models to predict dust
   accumulation while considering environmental and ageing factors.},

Title = {Short-term load forecasting method with variational mode decomposition
   and stacking model fusion},
Journal = {SUSTAINABLE ENERGY GRIDS \& NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {30},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {An accurate load forecasting method is critical to the distribution
   networks to match the supply with demand. In this paper, Variational
   Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Stacking model fusion are composed to
   obtain a short-term load forecasting method for real-time power
   dispatch. Firstly, a VMD algorithm decomposes the load series into
   dissimilar intrinsic mode functions (IMF), and the Approximate Entropy
   (ApEn) of each IMF is calculated to produce corresponding new
   components. Secondly, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
   Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest
   Neighbour (KNN) are used as basic models to predict each IMF. Thirdly,
   the data fusion problem, which is always oversimplified treated, is
   solved under the Stacking integration framework. The final prediction
   results of these basic models are obtained by an ensemble learning
   method. The prediction results of each component are superposed and then
   a weighted fusion method is carried out. It is demonstrated that the
   component estimation is well fused using the Stacking model fusion
   method. In comparison with the experimental results of XGBoost,
   VMD-XGBoost, and KNN methods, the proposed method can significantly
   improve the accuracy. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Performance prediction of solar still with a high-frequency ultrasound
   waves atomizer using random vector functional link/heap-based optimizer},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {170},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this work, the thermal performance of a single slop solar still (SS)
   using a high-frequency ultrasound waves atomizer (HFUWA) as a humidifier
   was predicted through developing an artificial intelligence model. To
   minimize or avoid mathematical analysis or performing costly
   experimental work, a set of machine-learning (ML) algorithms were
   performed to predict the SS productivity and basin water temperature. A
   powerful ML algorithm called random vector functional link network
   (RVFL) is optimized using three different advanced metaheuristic
   optimizers, namely sine cosine algorithm (SCA), manta ray foraging
   optimizer (MRFO), heapbased optimizer (HBO). These optimizers are used
   to obtain the optimal parameters of RVFL model that maximize its
   prediction accuracy. By using experimental data, the algorithms; RVFL,
   R-SCA, R-MRFO and R-HBO, were trained and tested. The operational
   variables such as number of atomizers, water depth, and on-off time were
   used as input variables of the algorithms. The appropriate
   meteorological variables: atmospheric temperature, speed of wind, and
   solar intensity were considered as the input parameters. Results
   indicated that the RHBO has a high ability to find out the process
   responses as a function of inputs in nonlinear relationship. RVFLHBO
   achieves low RMSE, MRE, MAE and COV of 44.840, 0.512, 35.497 and 48.539
   for water yield and 6.660, -0.019, 5.090 and 13.856 for water
   temperature. The low values of RMSE, MAE, MRE, and COV obtained by
   RVFL-HBO indicate its high accuracy over other models. Hence, it can be
   considered as the best choice for modeling the water desalination
   process in SS.},

Abstract = {Solar stills (SSs) have emerged as highly efficient solutions for
   converting saline or contaminated water into potable water, addressing a
   critical need for water purification. This study aims to predict and
   optimize SS performance, emphasizing the importance of enhancing
   productivity in various applications, including domestic, agricultural,

   intensity, ambient temperature, wind speed, and structural design, are
   crucial in determining SS performance. By harnessing the power of
   contemporary machine learning techniques, this study adopts Deep Neural
   Networks, with a special emphasis on the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
   model, aiming to more accurately predict SS output. The research
   presents a headto-head comparison of diverse hyperparameter optimization
   techniques, with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) notably outpacing the
   rest when combined with MLP. This optimized PSO-MLP model was
   particularly proficient when paired with a specific type of solar
   collector, registering impressive metrics like a COD of 0.98167 and an
   MSE of 0.00006. To summarize, this research emphasizes the

Abstract = {Air Temperature (AT) is a crucial parameter for many disciplines such as
   hydrology, irrigation, ecology and agriculture. In this respect,
   accurate AT prediction is required for applications related to
   agricultural operations, energy generation, traveling, human and
   recreational activities. In this study, four different machine learning
   approaches such as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with
   Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), ANFIS with Subtractive Clustering (SC) and ANFIS
   with Grid Partition (GP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
   network were used to make one-hour ahead and one-day ahead short-term AT
   predictions. Concerning the test site, the measured AT data were
   obtained from a solar power plant installed in the city of Tarsus,
   Turkey. Correlation coefficient (R), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used as quality metrics for prediction.
   Predicted values of the LSTM, ANFIS-FCM, ANFIS-SC and ANFIS-GP models
   were compared with the observed values by evaluating their prediction
   errors. According to the hourly AT prediction, the RMSE values in the
   testing process were found to be 0.644 (degrees C), 0.721 (degrees C),
   0.722 (degrees C) and 0.830 (degrees C) for the LSTM, ANFIS-FCM,
   ANFIS-SC and ANFIS-GP models, respectively. On the other hand, the RMSE
   values of the corresponding methods for daily AT prediction were
   obtained as 1.360 (degrees C), 1.366 (degrees C), 1.405 (degrees C) and
   1.905 (degrees C), respectively. The comparison of hourly and daily
   prediction results revealed that the LSTM neural network provided the
   highest accuracy results in both one-hour ahead and one-day ahead
   short-term AT predictions, and mainly presented higher performance than
   all ANFIS models.},

Title = {An Integrated Framework Based on an Improved Gaussian Process Regression
   and Decomposition Technique for Hourly Solar Radiation Forecasting},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The precise forecast of solar radiation is exceptionally imperative for
   the steady operation and logical administration of a photovoltaic
   control plant. This study proposes a hybrid framework (CBP) based on
   complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise
   (CEEMDAN), an enhanced Gaussian process regression with a newly designed
   physical-based combined kernel function (PGPR), and the backtracking
   search optimization algorithm (BSA) for solar radiation forecasting. In
   the CEEMDAN-BSA-PGPR (CBP) model, (1) the CEEMDAN is executed to divide
   the raw solar radiation into a few sub-modes; (2) PACF (partial
   autocorrelation coefficient function) is carried out to pick the
   appropriate input variables; (3) PGPR is constructed to predict each
   subcomponent, respectively, with hyperparameters optimized by BSA; (4)
   the final forecasting result is produced by combining the forecasted
   sub-modes. Four hourly solar radiation datasets of Australia are
   introduced for comprehensive analysis and several models available in
   the literature are established for multi-step ahead prediction to
   demonstrate the superiority of the CBP model. Comprehensive comparisons
   with the other nine models reveal the efficacy of the CBP model and the
   superb impact of CEEMDAN blended with the BSA, respectively. The CBP
   model can produce more precise results compared with the involved models
   for all cases using different datasets and prediction horizons.
   Moreover, the CBP model is less complicated to set up and affords extra
   decision-making information regarding forecasting uncertainty.},
